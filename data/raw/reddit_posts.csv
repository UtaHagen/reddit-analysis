Question about discount factor and present value|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1liubwr/question_about_discount_factor_and_present_value/|charlesfish69|1750717276.0|5|1liubwr|0.33|"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to ask this, but I'm practicing for the FM exam and I feel like I found a mistake in the practice test, but it's probably me not understanding the concept lol. I was given v\^n = 0.76 and told to calculate the present value of a payment stream of 300 after 2n years. The solution says: PV = 300 / (1+i)\^(2n), = 300v\^(2n), which all makes sense.... but it then goes on to say v\^(2n) = (0.76)\^2, which cannot be true?? It seems like it's equating v\^(2n) = v\^(n) \* v\^(n), but that's not how exponents work?? The full question is here, in case I missed some outside info:

David can receive one of the following two payment streams:

(i) 100 at time 0, 200 at time n years, and 300 at time 2n years

(ii) 600 at time 10 years

At an annual effective interest rate of i, the present values of the two streams are equal.

My experience in Mercer Retirement as an International Student|80|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1linbe7/my_experience_in_mercer_retirement_as_an/|Visual_Entire|1750700948.0|8|1linbe7|0.97|"I was an international student. Graduated from college, passed an exam, and finished an internship. I had a couple of offers from different companies that offered me sponsorship for a work visa, but the only remote position was offered by Mercer Retirement. During this time, I was able to work because of my OPT and OPT STEM, which grants me a work permit for a total of three years after graduating. I had about two years and some change left when I started at Mercer. 

From what I researched, there were three possible times I could enter the work visa lottery before my OPT ended. Not sure on how true the odds are, but everyone seems to think there is a 1/3 chance of being selected in each drawing.

The first deadline was very close to my starting time, and I inquired about it with my supervisors. By the time HR responded, the deadline had passed. I continued my work as normal.

After some time, I was assigned to a client for which I had to work with a lead who is also not from the US. She has been at Mercer for a long time, and everyone considered her a great person. We met over a video call. She asked me a lot of questions regarding my immigration process and asked me how I got hired since I am not in the US permanently. I told her that the company had promised to sponsor me, and she looked surprised. She told me that she was shocked because she had been trying to get her friends from her country hired at Mercer, but the company had told her repeatedly that they don't sponsor. I tried to change the subject after this because I didn't want her to feel bad or anything. 

A couple of days after, I received an unusual call from one of the higher-up managers telling me that someone had raised a complaint about the fact that Mercer was working on my sponsorship and that I should keep it on the low and not mention it to anybody. They confirmed to me that they were still going to work with HR about getting the process started. 

The deadline time is approaching, and I reach back out about my sponsorship requirements, asking them if they need any extra information from me to get the process started. The same manager calls me and tells me that the company has updated their policy and that they do not sponsor anymore, but that that might change because of my situation. 

I felt betrayed and cheated. 

I worked overtime, prioritized work over study time, worked while sick, took work from other colleagues who were struggling with their workload, met all my billable hour goals while others did not. I had to deal with the lack of time management from different leads which led me to work unnecessary overtime. Every performance meeting I had went well, and all my goals were met every year. I did all of this intending to be exceptional and to demonstrate that it was worth taking a chance on me. But they just used me. Denied me appropriate study materials, gave me 1% raises when inflation was at least at 6-8%. Most importantly, they left me hanging. By promising to sponsor me and then going back on their commitment. I rejected other companies that promised to sponsor me, and I tried to reach back to them, but it was too late. Positions were already filled, and I only had one more chance at a lottery.  

Several people started leaving the team in my last year. 

I started saving heavily from my already unfair salary to prepare for several months of unemployment after my last work permit expired. I even asked for some sort of severance bonus, but I got denied by everyone in management. When my work permit was close to expiring, they asked me several times to send them a letter stating that I was leaving the team voluntarily, and I refused. I had a meeting with an HR lead to complain about the situation and ask for help. She dismissed everything I told her and then proceeded to say, ""That is how life goes"". 

Every time I raised a concern on the matter, it always needed to go up the corporate ladder.

I understand that getting sponsored is not a guarantee since it is a lottery. But the fact that they did not even try to get the process started showed me everything I needed to know.  

The amount of stress and emotional damage this experience caused is something I do not wish upon anybody.

Everything is testable. I saw a question on tweedie dist, GARCH/ARCH for example. There are some easy win questions on the exam but to pass you have to go through a fair bit of tough ones.

Understand why we you need PCA and when to use PCA. Understand why we want to boost, use random forests and the trade off of using them. What each method does and doesn’t don’t do.

I made a few post over the last two weeks about my situation. A few of you had advised me to share my resume for review. 

A quick summary again for those who didn't see my other post. 

\- I have 5+ years of experience in insurance as actuary and 4+ exams. Close to ASA (did all the FAP and VEEs)

\- I had 2.5 year employment gap due to personal reason. During those times I did some self employment work and made decent money but I have young kids now and would like to get back to something more consistent

\- Have been having a hard time finding work or even landing interviews. I even applied to jobs requiring less experience such jobs asking for 1-3 years of experience. 

\- I also prefer remote work but I didn't exclusively apply to remote work. I understand that remote work might be hard to find now but I was willing to take a pay cut if I can get something remote. 

\-I also applied to a few health jobs, which I thought was interesting during one of my internships in college. However, my work after college was not in health. Just curious, is switching from life to health difficult?

I have 5 years of experience in life insurance as actuary. Passed 4 exams and did the FAP/VEEs. I took 2.5 years off for personal reasons. I did some contract work / side projects during those times.

I would like to ask for some advice/ tips on getting through the hurdle so I can at least get an interview. I have included a few thoughts below but any other advice would be appreciated. 

\- I had an employment gap. I did some side projects for small businesses on the side. Advice from a friend said to actually put that down for the employment gap which I did recently.  
\- I have applied to jobs that required even less experience than I have. For example I have applied to jobs requiring only 1-3 years of experience. Is that a bad idea? Would they see this as a red flag? I am truly okay with taking a pay cut and starting over to learn again.   
\- I used a generic resume to apply for most jobs. I was told recently that I should tailor my resume to each job. I started making small adjustments for each job application but not sure if that will help yet.   
\- Should I be sitting for exams while applying? Since I took the break from work I haven't took any exams. "|"[""You might get better responses if you have a recent exam pass.

Background: 1 exam and couple modules away from ASA

Company # 1: Big Life Insurance firm.
Position: 1yr term contract internship program. 
Advantage: inline with my FSA/life insurance experience goal.
Disadvantage: 1 year term, moving to a different city.

Company #2: Smaller pension company
Position: Pension Analyst full time.
Advantage: full time, stable, don’t have to move away.
Disadvantage: not inline with my career path. 

My biggest question would be, if I took pension company and want to jump back to life insurance after getting close to FSA, will the road be extra difficult?

My current plan is to take the life insurance internship and try to bid out for a full time position while I am within the company internal hiring system and apply externally as well

Damn this really is a close scenario to yours looooool. I chose the one year contract for multiple reasons:\n\n1. I don't like pension plans and felt like health and benefits would be too similar.\n\n2. The opportunity to be in a new city and move out of my parents was enticing.\n\n3. The contract was paying more.\n\n4. I knew the 1-year contract would give me the experience I needed to find a job later on (in life).\n\n5.

b/  we can provide hundreds of 40 year olds with a CT scan for £1m, say one hundred scans.

  
And it's not an either/or, because the money has to be allocated from an all-round point of view.

  
But is there some sort of standard statistic that is applied, some sort of cost x benefit metric?  Or is that politically unacceptable?  Or is it not done quantitatively?

  
Basically my question is, is there a utility function used by actuaries in government settings?  And what is it like.

  
Any discussion would be appreciated to help my curiosity, and I apologise for not wording it very well.

  
Thanks in advance for your answers (if there are any)."|"['This subreddit (including myself) has a heavy USA focus, so not too many people are going to be able to speak to government decision making like this, since it’s not the norm in the US. However, in health economics the standard is the [Quality-Adjusted Life Year](https://icer.org/our-approach/methods-process/cost-effectiveness-the-qaly-and-the-evlyg/). Anyone wanting to do some sort of objective decision making for rationing health care (based on social good rather than profit motive) would likely use QALYs on a cost-adjusted basis (e.g. QALYs added per $1M in spend.) This gets after exactly what you’re asking about, since it considers not just “lives saved/affected” but how much meaningful living is added to the person’s life-span, how much quality of life improves, etc.\n\nIn the US, actuaries are not really involved in the decisions around what gets covered and how favorably it gets covered. We more just crunch the numbers around pricing and funding needed for the product designs that others within the organization push for. There’s no indication to me that the people calling the shots on this are really factoring in objective information on optimizing patient outcomes. It’s more going to be driven by profitability and capturing market share for the organization.', 'So first off, it\'s doctors making treatment decisions like that, not the government. At least in the US, government is very rarely involved at that level. And if they are, it\'s probably for a foster kid who the state is directly responsible for. Money and allocating limited resources are not a consideration I\'ve ever seen at that level outside of COVID when hospitals had to make decisions about who got limited beds and respirators. And again, those were decisions based on health outcomes.\n\nA layer up to the provider/hospital level, they generally spend money on new technology or adding capacity for services based on what brings in the most money, or they can fundraise for, or get a government grant for. It\'s not a dichotomy of allocating resources, it\'s just revenue maximization. ""Do we expand the ER or add more cancer treatment beds? Which will make us more money so we can grow more?"" Sometimes it\'s more altruistic and based on need, too.\n\nAnother layer up at the government org level, from what I\'ve seen, funding is generally either based on research to improve outcomes or create efficiencies, or they\'re pretty political and directed by legislatures. When the legislatures are involved, it\'s mostly about which advocacy group or lobbyist is loudest/makes the government look worst in the news, or is a new person\'s pet project.\n\nConsiderations for what to do with equivalent money are never such a dichotomy like your example. Or if they are, it\'s in terms of government program A vs government program B, not treatment for person A vs treatment for person B. \n\nThe actuary\'s role in all this is primary to supply information and truth for legislatures and directors to make decisions. We participate in the conversation and have opinions, but there are dozens of voices in the room and we\'re mostly seen as the people who run the numbers.', 'New Zealand’s public pharmaceutical buyer does this sort of analysis when deciding which drugs it funds through the public health system.\xa0\n\nhttps://www.pharmac.govt.nz/assets/cost-utility-analysis-explained-2015-08.pdf', 'No clue, I would guess there would be an ASOP against this sort of thing (on a non-research level at least) but if I were to approach it I would probably base it on the expected amount of years left in an insured’s life multiplied by the inverse of the cost of the treatment(s) or something along those lines and base the best investments off of what has the highest number.', 'Yes thanks that has answered my questions. \n\nIt actually seems like a problem , a big problem, that actuaries are saying ""here\'s what maximises profit, I\'ve crunched the numbers"" and then the executives and/or politicians go, ""well, in that case we\'ll take that option""\n\n This probably caused the ""sub-prime"" crisis didn\'t it, because that whole thing was based on guessing how likely sub prime (bad credit) borrowers were to repay (for which an over optimistic guess was used), or maybe that sub prime crisis was just simple corruption, a get rich quick but tank the economy in the process.  \n\nI know I\'m not making sense now.  It\'s late and I haven\'t slept.  \n\n\nThank you for your reply.  I did study quality of life adjusted years a long time ago, I had forgotten.  And you\'re right it does answer my question. \n\nHow do people on here feel, as humans and as actuaries, that we can give answers to questions, but those answers have lots of important side-notes, and the side notes are ignored?  If that\'s the case, I can\'t say cos I\'m not an actuary.', ""As someone said, this is a USA focused subreddit, I'm actually British so we do have decisions that are made using public money effectively.  The doctors basically are employed by the govt here.\n\nMy example wasn't a dichotomy, I guess you skim read it which is fine.  The idea is how do you allocate funds when outcomes are not defined by dollar outcomes.  This is partially the case in the US with Medicaid/Medicare/Obamacare isn't it?  Do they have some sort of actuarial work available?\n\nAnyway I wanted a discussion and that's what I got so I do want to say thank you.\n\nI suppose it would be gauche to assign numbers to people's suffering.\n\nTo make a further point (and I know this is kind of Actuarial Science class 101), maximising dollar return is not necessarily the best option, in general.  There are other considerations.\n\nSo, can I ask, do actuaries deal with non-measurable stuff in everyday work?\n\nI was interested in how dealing with non-measurable stuff actually manifests in everyday practice.  Can someone say a bit about that?\n\nSorry for being so dull and boring."", ""Thanks I'll take a look now."", ""Well that would account for years left of life and the cost, directly, but not for the relative increase in outcome - point being saving someone's life is not the same as improving their health somewhat.\n\nI was just curious how this is dealt with in general in actuarial work.  In fact it might be rare that the outcome is purely a correspondence where the financial outcome represents mathematically a measure of how good that outcome is.  \n\nIf this sort of thing isn't done by actuaries, then I think it should be.""]"

Should I take a promotion at a non-traditional actuarial team?|19|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1lfjbo6/should_i_take_a_promotion_at_a_nontraditional/|UWboi|1750360355.0|8|1lfjbo6|0.95|"Some Background: I am currently working in a fairly non-traditional corporate actuarial team (think ERM adjacent) where there's not much technical skills involved but I get exposure to the executive team, and oversight and understanding of the company and its lines of businesses. I have been in this team for 2 years and also have 1 year of experience at a traditional pricing team at a life insurer. So about 3 years of full time experience (+8m internship experience in pricing/valuation).

I am in a unique situation where I have the opportunity to move back to the pricing team as an individual contributor or be promoted to a managerial role at my current team, which would be a great opportunity to move up so early in my career. However, I'm also concerned about my skills and experience not translating well into traditional actuarial roles which could close off future opportunities.

Is becoming a manager worth it despite the non-traditional role? Would it actually open up more opportunities instead? Or should I stick to the pricing role and hope to eventually become a manager there?

Partial Credibility|4|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1lf45ln/partial_credibility/|Desperate_Penalty690|1750315951.0|9|1lf45ln|0.75|"Trying to understand the justification for the use of partial credibility.

I want to update a mortality table for my insured population based on the experience I have. There is limited experience, so the updated table keeps the same shape and will only be adjusted by an overall factor.

The approach is to use the ratio of the observed Actual to Expected mortality as the factor to adjust the table. But if the A/E value is not fully credible, you might not want to go all the way, but take some weighted average of the realised A/E and 100%. The idea being that you are giving the original table the benefit of the doubt and only want to deviate much if there is sufficient certainty that the alternative is correct.

My understanding of the standard limited fluctuation approach is as follows: take some confidence interval surrounding the A/E estimate that you define as fully credible, e.g. 90% probability of being within 5% of the estimated value, requiring at least 1,082 expected deaths. If in our case we observed only a quarter of those deaths, the partial credibility approach would take only half of the realised A/E and half of 100%, as the factor for the new table. This approach ensures that the volatility surrounding the resulting factor is equal to the volatility surrounding a fully credible A/E value. So, it results in a factor that is as precise as a fully credible factor.

Now, forgetting about actuarial theory and just treating this as a statistics problem, my approach would be to construct a confidence interval for the observed number of deaths under the null-hypothesis that some mortality table is correct. Then if the observed number of deaths falls outside this interval, that table would be rejected. This would then lead to a range around the realised A/E, of mortality tables that can’t be rejected. And it seems to me that the updated table should sit within this range.

Now comes my question, applying the partial credibility approach leads to a table that falls outside of the range that can’t be rejected. Why would I go with the table implied by the partial credibility approach, that makes the observed number of deaths too unlikely?"|"['I think there can be several aspects of this that could be causing you issues. I can’t see the modeling, so I just have to assume all the statistical work is done correctly. Even assuming that, I think you are either applying limited fluctuation credibility incorrectly, or not understanding exactly what it does. \n\nWhen doing statistics on small observation sets, results can vary pretty wildly by the inclusion of a few more observations. You’re essentially determining how much data you need to trust that a particular experience set differs from the population set. If the experience set has very low variation around a high mean, you need less data to feel confident in the results. Alternatively, high variation lower mean suggests you need more data. \n\nNotice the formula for classical credibility has nothing to do with the population data set (as opposed to more sophisticated methods like Bayesian, where you have a prior and posterior distribution, or buhlmann which is least squares Bayesian), it only cares about the experience set and what you need to feel confident in that set. This is why in Bayesian, you can get full credibility after just one result if the result is impossible to come from the alternative set. It’s because Bayesian actually takes into account the difference between the populations, as does Buhlmann but in a less rigorous manner. The greater the difference between the sets, the more confident you can be observations come from one set and not another.\n\nBack to classical credibility, not accounting for the difference between the population experience set means that if the two sets are very different, then of course the observations from the experience set will not pass a null hypothesis test of the credibility weighted set, especially if you have low credibility. You’re essentially in between two different models and getting the worst of both worlds.\n\nBut it sounds like you may be applying this method incorrectly. The mortality table you already have, where is it from? Is it the result of last year’s mortality table that was credibility adjusted to reflect A/E? And that table was made from the previous year’s credibility adjusted table, so you eventually have a Frankenstein table of partially credibility adjusted mortalities stacking up over time? Or is it from your national experience set and you’re trying to adjust it to show the experience set for a particular state? If the former, I’m not surprised you are having issues, if the latter, I’d say you need to figure out first why a particular set of your experience differs so greatly from the rest of your experience, maybe the population data set just isn’t representative of this subset of experience. \n\nUsing a population set as the basis for pricing when it isn’t representative of the new area being priced is an actuarial story as old as the profession itself. Usually doesn’t cause issues because you’re talking about a relatively smaller and newer book compared to a larger more set book, so you’re incurring relatively low financial risk, but it has been known for this risk to really hurt a business, especially when the newer book becomes disproportionately large before repricing can occur. I personally work in health, so short term, so any misses we have of this nature are corrected within a year, long term is a different beast.', ""My general take is that 'limited fluctuation' was desiged to limit the fluctuation of an estimate. It has little to do with the accuracy of an estimate or its probability of being in a range. You are saying if I have N observations, how large does N have to be so that any subset of N from the same data would give me an estimate that wont fluctuate more than a given percent. \n\nUsing observed claims for any credibility has been a soap box moment for me for a decade. I even argued with CA DOI on the topic. If you have no observed claims, why should that indicate you have no credibility? Shouldnt it, at some portfolio size, indicate you have the worlds best policy pool?"", ""I was thinking a little bit in the same direction as what you describe. That is, when applying partial credibility  you are using an heuristic approach to come to a new estimate and it must start with a base table that is not too far off.\n\nIt is clear that the weighted average resulting from the limited fluctuation\xa0aproach, does not consider at all how far away the experience is from the expected under the base table and if you are very far off then you would much sooner be willing to change even under high uncertainty, compared to when you are close and would need much more certainty to change the table.\n\nThe base table is really an industry table which has been scaled for each individual policy to reflect the life expectancy that came out of the underwriting process. Over time we are experiencing A/E of say 60%, with only 100 observed deaths. Sqrt(100/1,083)=0.3, meaning that the updated table would be adjusted with 0.3 x 60% + 0.7 x 100% = 88%.\n\nBut the problem is that if I take 88% of the table I would expect far more deaths than the 100 we observed and 100 falls far outside that confidence interval. It feels like this is more of an heuristic solution that does not provide acceptable results when the base table is too far off and experience has low credibility.\n\nLet's say that an adjustment of 70% would produce a table that puts the 100 observed deaths just outside of the confidence interval for number of observed deaths. Then it feels like going with this 70% would be a better approach that would also take into consideration not changing the table by too much and then risk having to move back in the other direction as more data comes in.\n\nedit: Yes, the Bayesian approach is I think what would be needed in this case, so that it would play a role how far away the observations are from the base table in determining the weights. I will look into that."", 'i am currently trying to argue an unusual salary scale assumption with pbgc so god speed to you lol, it is an impossible feat to get approval for more esoteric assumptions in my experience', 'Yes, it seems to me that all that limited fluctuation is doing, is finding the linear combination of old value and point estimate from experience that would have the same volatility as a fully credible value fully based on experience. In other words it is setting the precision of the results to the same precision as the fully credible estimate, without considering accuracy.', 'And I think that is the misstep. I’ve only ever used limited fluctuation credibility to splice out different parts of a whole. For example, I can come to some estimate based on the totality of my national experience. But I need the estimate for just one state. For a large state, it is fully credible, and therefore, its own experience is all I need. For small states, not credible, they get mixed with the national estimate based on the z average. In this way, it’s not a heuristic, it’s more a way of hedging our bets. Also, there’s actuarial judgement involved, if I believe the national estimate is way off the mark, I need to make further adjustments. This is where the ‘art’ comes in for our profession, and it’s not easily articulated how to go about that.\n\nUsing a completely separate experience set and crossing that with your own much smaller experience set is the issue and is not a proper use of classical credibility. Im sure there’s some assumption of classical credibility this violates, I just don’t know it off hand. Probably some form of the national set is at least partially representative of the experience set but you can’t verify that unless you have demographic info of the population set. I’d recommend a buhlmann approach instead, since it will take into account the different in sample means and variations, especially since it sounds like you’re dealing with a small enough experience set that full credibility will not be achieved. I think Bayesian will be too volatile for your uses.', 'Yeah I got  no where with them lol.

Why is it so hard to find an actuarial job in Canada, even with international experience and ASA?|29|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1leotkx/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_an_actuarial_job_in/|Successful_Jelly_604|1750271663.0|16|1leotkx|0.84|"Hi all,
I'm currently job hunting in Canada for actuarial roles and finding it surprisingly difficult to get traction. I wanted to ask for insights from others who might have gone through something similar.

Here’s a quick summary of my background:

ASA credential completed

Solid degree in Actuarial Science

2+ years of experience in reserving, valuation, and modeling roles at various companies across North America and Asia

Technical skills in Python, SQL, VBA, Excel, Microsoft Access, and more



Despite this, I’ve found it hard to get interviews or callbacks for actuarial analyst roles in Canada — even entry-level ones where I match or exceed the requirements.

Is this a common experience for internationally trained actuaries? Could it be the lack of Canadian experience, not holding ACIA/FSA yet, or maybe something else?

I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or insight from others who’ve navigated the Canadian actuarial job market — or from recruiters/hiring managers who can shed some light.

Thanks in advance!"|"['Canada has a disproportionate number of actuarial students being churned out by very very good, competitive university programs (many of which have work-study programs such that their students graduate with up to 24 months of full time work experience) and a pretty small number of jobs due to their consolidated insurance industry. \n\nYour background is equivalent to many recent graduates, and I think a lot of employers hire students they have worked with before. \n\n  \nDefinitely an up hill battle.

I’m currently finishing my master studies in Actuarial sciences. I have recently started working as an actuary in life insurance company and I’m looking for some ideas for my master thesis.
Ideally I want to choose a topic that is closely related both to my profession and my company, since I’ll have better data for research.

I have few ideas in mind, but I’m seeking more inspiration and a clearer direction for developing those ideas further.
My main goal is to find a topic that isn’t too complex to execute but still adds substantial value to me and the company i work for. 
Whether it’s improving pricing models, risk assessment strategies, Solvency II, IFRS17, or something related to innovation in life insurance, I’m open to any suggestions! :)

If anyone has worked on something similar or can think of something that might come in handy, I’d really appreciate it. I’m starting my career now, so I don’t have much work experience  in the area. Therefore, anything at all is welcome. 

Thank you in advance 🙏"|[]
Early Actuarial Career Advice Request|7|https://i.redd.it/bv2x20n3jl7f1.jpeg|Relyt2021|1750213426.0|19|1le5sy7|0.71|"To the reader, I hope you are having a wonderful day. I know there's been a lot of resume posts recently and I apologize for contributing to it, but I just feel very lost and discouraged right now, I won't give up though! 

I was not able to get an internship due to travel reasons. During my second to last year of college, my family and I planned on visiting family for a month and a half in Cambodia during the summer, but then the flight was cancelled, and by that time, the internship window had already passed. As a result, we decided to go during the next summer, the summer of graduation. I hadn't seen a lot of family members from Cambodia for like seven years so I decided to go, giving up my chances for an internship. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't gone, as not having an internship made things more difficult.

For the past few months, I have been applying for every actuarial analyst position that pops up, but haven't had any luck. Also recently, I have been applying for financial and data analyst positions as well. Also with no luck...  

Additionally, I just started a course on Udemy to improve my SQL and Python skills. I am about to finish the SQL course and will move on the Python one, I'm hoping this will help. Besides posting the Udemy certificate, should I do anything else? I'm thinking of doing some projects but I'm not so sure as to what specifically.

In all honesty, I never worked a real job since my mom wanted me to focus on education. I just trade stocks which have been extremely successful for me, but that doesn't necessarily translate into experience. I have spent so much time researching stocks-going through countless financial statements, spending hours listening to conference calls and federal reserve speeches, learning how every variable (from inflation to the bond market) affects stocks and financial markets, and organizing my whole week around earnings. Despite all that, I have nothing to show, I've been mentioning it in my cover letters, but to no avail. To me, it was a full time commitment, but to an employer, I probably appeared as just a person who only dabbled in stocks.  

Is there anything I should do to my resume? I won't give up job-searching, as I am committed to this field. Furthermore, I currently have a ""it's this or nothing"" mentality for the actuarial field, and with all the rejections, I've been feeling really discouraged lately. Are there any other positions I could apply for? Is there anything else I can do to improve? I feel so lost and discouraged right now and would appreciate some advice. I am willing to do internships as well, but they want me in college. I am also willing to volunteer and accept a lower pay just for some experience (I have mentioned that in my cover letter and LinkedIn messages, but had little luck). 

Anyways, thank you for taking some time out of your day to ready this, I greatly appreciate it, as it means a lot to me."|"[""First thing is that it simply does not look professional. Use Latex and follow a template to make it seem more professional and also ATS friendly. For the experiences, you really need to improve how you are presenting them. The bullet points feel extremely bland and it seems like you didn't really put much effort into them, or the job at all. Try to follow the structure of: what you did, how you did it, what was the result. Each bullet point should be structured like that, and heavy on the last part. Recruiters want to see that you actually provided something for the company, more than just being there. Something like the high school TA role, you said you used statistics and Excel, but that doesn't tell me anything. How did you gather the statistics? What did the statistics tell you? What did you do with these findings? Be specific. The projects and skills section can be structured more as well, split projects and skills, but remember, quality is better than quantity. The projects can be their own section, but try to be more specific with them. List each one as their own thing (like in the experiences) and follow the exact same bullet point format. What you did, how you did it, and what it achieved. You should have at least 2 bullets per project, and then if possible, provide a link to the source or a demo. Remember to be consistent throughout the entire thing, structure each section the exact same to make sure it is easy on the eyes. Once you work on it quite a bit, I would suggest you also reach out to family/friends or anyone you know that is in a recruiting position or has done recruiting before to simply look over your resume and give you feedback.

What impact did you make? Also it looks like you got a business degree, not a math degree so put your degree as ""B.S.

It won\'t be easy but have hope for yourself!', ""Resume: I second the idea to use a template! Your bullet points also seem very bare-bones. Remember to try and phrase your bullet points to appeal to an actuarial recruiter, emphasizing things like the use of technical skills and problem solving. I'd recommend making a short 2-3 sentence paragraph for job responsibilities under each job heading, then using the bullet points for achievements only. Think tangible, measurable ways you had a positive impact in the role, using numbers whenever possible to quantify it. You could also use bolding to highlight the key skills in your bullet points - you want the reader to see your value in a glance. \n\nExperience/skills: Besides taking the SQL/Python courses, I'd highly recommend completing projects too.

I would like some advice on the concerns I have with my career.

Here is my background:

* **8 years** at an insurance company in Actuarial Analytics department. The department focuses on building out digital products for internal and B2B clients.
* **First 3 years:** Focused on coding actuarial models and modernizing spreadsheets into digital tools/products.
* **Next 3 years:** Led a product team (developers + analysts) and earned actuarial credentials.
* **Last 2 years:** Moved into a strategic leadership role, managing multiple digital actuarial products. Responsibilities include stakeholder communication, team coordination, and a ton of roadmap planning.

Here are my concerns:

1. **Job Market Fit:** My current role (actuarial + product + tech + strategy) is rare, resulting in uncertainty if let go.
2. **Technical to Strategic:** My shift away from technical work may hurt my value in the actuarial field, where technical depth is often prized.
3. **Career Path Dilemma:**
   * Trying to return to traditional actuarial work (in which I would likely be poorly compensated for my level) versus
   * Doubling down on the technical/product/AI path (potentially through further education in computer science, data science, or AI)."|"[""I'm in a similar situation, but a few years behind you on your timeline. I'm a fellow and I make pricing and reserving software, and have done some project management, but if you were to actually ask me to price or reserve anything I would struggle with it, although I think I can at least make something that's sort of OK if I had to.\n\nBut I don't think I could easily get a role at my same level of seniority doing traditional work, although I think I could if I wanted to move back to management in predictive modeling, but I don't really want to do that anymore, at least right now, since I'm kind of tired of being roped into fads that go nowhere (AI right now).\n\nIf I get fired and wind up needing a way to get money, I'm thinking of maybe starting my own company to sell actuarial software (pricing, reserving, large accounts, reinsurance, work comp applications), I think I have the technical skills to make a product, and I do have some sales experience from a prior role that I hope would come in handy if I need to market it. My current plan is to give myself 3 years to build a product, and if I wind up needing to find some kind of corp job that doesn't pay as much as I want because I fell behind on my mortgage payments, then I'll take it I guess.\n\nAt your level I would think things are a lot more people-skills oriented so you may not need to actually be a hands-on expert in the thing you manage. At some level of seniority it will be impossible to know how to do everything people do under you anyways. What you would need to do now is to know how to recruit, listen, and manage someone who is, and keep them happy. Network heavily with insurance executives. Know how to distill directives from upper management into realistic goals for your team, given that you listened to them on what's realistic and not, etc. So I think you can still move up if you continue to hone your communication and interpersonal skills."", ""This sounds pretty similar to a consulting actuary role where there is often less technical and the focus is more strategic, product development, and selling.

If it helps, i suspect companies understand that people can learn new skills.\n\nYou may not be able to recite the stat accounting regulations blind folded but you are technical, and can think for yourself.

CAS actuaries often consider pricing and reserving (on the same P&C line) as different practice areas. SOA actuaries often consider life vs health vs pension as different practice areas.\n\n\nI bring up this anecdote to say that actuaries tend to pigeonhole themselves when they think about their skill set and experience. Based on your post, I'd say you have a skill set in the product management function; and you possess domain knowledge in both the insurance industry and the healthcare industry, You should feel more than confident to apply for roles managing other software used in insurance, like Guidewire ClaimCenter or Duck Creek Billing, or analytics products aimed to support actuaries like Verisk or Definitive, as well as the myriad of other product offerings for these industries.\xa0\n\n\nSo while your current role is rare in a microcosm, the experience you are accumulating is much more broadly applicable than what you are giving yourself credit for.

Quit my actuarial exams a long time ago; no longer a member of the institute (UK based); would back my knowledge of Python  - I can build and deploy my own Python packages - but wouldn’t say I’m an absolute “expert” (or anywhere near as competent as a professional engineer); can’t really do BAU actuarial tasks such as insurance pricing (but I know how it works and what the lingo means). \n\nThe irony is, however, that the actuarial sector is actually screaming out for people with product management and software skills - skills which you have and most actuaries do not. How many times have you seen a solution in the actuarial sector that isn’t a very “good” or safe solution (and often feels like it solves the wrong problem in the first place) and yet it seems to be embedded within the team’s BAU? A good product manager or even a talented engineer can see how to improve that - better still is somebody who isn’t a generic product manager or engineer but somebody who also can talk the language of an actuary. Now you’re onto something there… \n\nThe problem is, we’re still in this transitional phase where many actuaries don’t know or see the benefit of these skill sets. But I think that’s slowly changing (for the better).', 'I would need some more info on what digital actuarial products really means. Is your experience more on the life, health, dental, vision, pensions, etc.', ""Similar situation, but I have fewer years on this path.\n\nI have no interest in traditional actuarial work so personally I would never return to that. But if there's something in traditional work that interests you, I don't see why not. Your strategic leadership experience should help, at senior levels you don't need to know all the technical details so I wouldn't worry about the technical stuff.\n\nI'm currently taking your 2nd approach which is doubling down on the technical/product/AI path. However I would go against a formal degree (which forces you to take a lot of classes that don't matter and a waste of time). If you can build a product and market/sell it to others, you have already proven that you know this stuff, it will convince people better than having a degree.\n\n  \nPS this is a niche group and we often don't have many people to talk about related topics such as interesting work or tech trend. I would like to start a group for people with similar background, interested?"", 'It’s eye-opening to see so many responses to this post - I often feel alone. I’m in a similar situation except I’m not even credentialed, but I have the actuarial knowledge plus other skill sets that fit really well with the role I’m in. My dilemma is around whether I should finish my exams and get credentialed, which will serve as a safety net for my career. What makes it even trickier for me is that my pay already exceeded what credentialed actuaries make at a similar level, and I’m way beyond the level where I can get study time. I do feel insecure at times for not having a structured career path. My role is tailored to my very specific blend of skill set, and if I lose my job for whatever reason, it will be hard to find another employer with the same demand for my skill set. I think for non-traditional actuaries like us (and me not even being one), recruiters can’t seem to help much. It’s up to us to advocate for ourselves and identify the next opportunity.', 'Is this based on the purely hypothetical situation of being let go? Or do you have concerns for your job in the immediate?\n\nIf this is an immediate concern, then you need to keep your network fresh with warm leads. Reconnect with former actuarial friends and classmates. Any industry colleagues that you have are fair game as well. At your level it’s going to be more about who you know that can give job referrals.\n\nAssuming you didn’t care for traditional actuarial work, I wouldn’t go back into it unless needed.\n\nIf this is hypothetical, then I would just take a few steps to review your finances, emergency funds and other savings that would keep you afloat. Estimate 3-5 months job search for senior roles. A degreed education beyond your credentials isn’t worthwhile in terms of ROI, but if you want to take a free/cheap tech course to learn new things then go ahead.', 'Change your framing. Forget about the fact that you’re an actuary for a moment. If you could go to any company you want, or take on any role you want what would it be? Design your resume and leverage your expertise with that question in mind.', 'You’d be really valuable to Amazon. I’ve seen it hiring a few actuaries in the recent past. Once you’ve spent a few years there, you’d be on a different plane whether it be back at an insurance company or at a large tech company.', 'I can relate', 'Talking about risk and returns of any sub-career path under the actuarial umbrella. High flying jobs sometime come with higher uncertainties. It’s the trade off that everyone faces.', 'Don’t worry. Nothing makes you special except the fact that a different insurer will have different systems, maybe prettier or uglier people, speaking a different base language, different organisation of spreadsheets, possibly different races. You’re an industry man/woman. Live your life. This is who you are. You’re a partial function expander/contractor. The little AI that you will be able to understand won’t be relevant for your job.\n\nDon’t worry. Look after the policyholders and shareholders. That’s ultimately what actuaries do.\n\nIf you want to segue out of actuarial you will have to take a pay drop and claw your way into something else. \n\nContrary to what you believe; actuaries don’t and are not capable of knowing everything. In fact they thrive on parochialism. Good luck!', 'I really resonate with your post, I’m in a similar situation myself, and wanted to share some insights that might help.\n\n\t1.\tFear of Not Finding Another Job: If your biggest fear is losing your job and not finding anything else, I’d recommend testing the waters now. Start applying to a few roles and see how the market responds. If you land interviews or even an offer, you’ll ease that fear by realizing your skill set is valuable, either in a traditional role or somewhere that overlaps with your unique profile. If no doors open immediately, that’s not a failure. It’s simply a signal to pivot and build something new with intention. Also, if your current company finds you valuable, it’s very likely that another company will too. And even if your skill set is rare in the market, that’s what makes you unique. Sometimes, carving your own path is the long-term advantage.\n\n\t2.\tWhere to Double Down: I’d encourage you to explore how insurers can truly leverage AI in their day-to-day operations. Every C-level at an insurance company talks about AI, but most don’t know how to actually implement it. I believe that’s where someone like you, who understands both actuarial thinking and digital product strategy, becomes a key asset. There’s a niche forming here, and you’re already ahead of the curve.\n\nFor context: I was let go a couple of months ago and instead of returning to a traditional role, I’m doubling down on full-stack development, and creating digital products with a focus on data science and analytics. It’s not an easy pivot, but it’s aligned with where I see long-term leverage. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend reading The Almanack of Naval Ravikant. One of the key takeaways is to build specific knowledge — the kind that can’t be easily replaced or trained for — and then leverage it with scale, whether through code, capital, or content. It’ll shift how you view your unique career path.\n\nYou’re in a strong position — just not a conventional one. That can be your biggest strength.', 'Most of the technical roles have already been moved off shore, and the really senior roles are filled internally from the one third of staff who are in high cost countries. \n\nI would question how you describe some of this, particularly the word “digital” which implies that you think spreadsheets are somehow analog products.', 'Thanks for the response. How do you feel about not being able to easily get a traditional role of similar level of seniority plus not having much employment opportunities in the actuarial software space? Aside from starting your own company, what is your backup plan should you leave (for whatever reasons) your current employer?\n\nI think your advice on what to do in the current role makes sense and I am embracing the fact that I do not know the technicals as much as an analyst on my team. However, when it comes to applying to actuarial jobs, the first bullet point in their job requirement is a technical requirement lol... I feel uneasy that most roles require technical knowledge and yet it something that I lack (or only used to have)', '3rd para sounds like an absolutely great idea 💡', ""Yes I guess actuarial software development and actuarial consulting are 2 other verticals aside from the traditional roles. The problem though is that there aren't much opportunities in my vertical (software) and that scares me when I think about the next steps in my career."", 'Yes I agree with you. The fact that I have gone through the rigour of actuarial exams should signal to companies and recruiters that I have what it takes to understand actuarial concepts. This should in theory satisfy employers that I would be able to catch up on any technical knowledge gaps I may have for this role. However, based on interviews I have gone to, hiring managers prefer someone already with the relevant experience. \n\nThis is also a part which annoys me lol - if my resume does not contain the desired (deal-breaker) experience, then why do they invite me down for an interview lol...', 'Agree. Important to have some confidence in yourself OP! You have a really great set of skills that I think make you stand out in a positive manner, especially for certain subsectors of the industry.', ""Thank you both for the responses. Actuarial Software might be the path for me to go down on, but where I am at, there aren't many of such companies. From what I see in this post, a lot of Actuarial Software house are in the US and not many in Asia where I am at. This could pose an additional challenge."", 'Thanks for the response, I feel that there are many actuaries who are on the peripherals of actuarial work. We no longer know who we are - are we actuaries, coders, data scientist, data analysts, project managers, product managers? I know that the easy answer is to say that we are all of them, but are we truly all of them or only an incomplete sum of parts of each of them?', ""I hope that we are moving towards a world where people like us in the intersection of actuarial science, technology and business are valued more.

Imagine all of the pricing spreadsheets that actuaries in my company (internal clients) and other insurers (external B2B clients) can be replaced by this software. The software has its fair share of User Interface done by software developers, but more critically, has a ton of complex calculation (e.g. IBNP calculations) and data handling (e.g. Actuarial assumptions) done by me in the past and by my analysts in the present. \n\nLet me know if you need more info!', 'Yes I would be interested to join such a group. I would also like to brainstorm possible projects to take on and maybe work together!', 'I am in the exact same situation too! Have managed to carve out a reasonably successful career without an actuarial qualification (I did about 40% of the exams but never continued) and have now found myself in the “software expert” niche of actuarial teams (often helping to build and deploy Python libraries and APIs for the wider actuarial division). \n\nI’ve also significantly outstripped the pay of a newly qualified actuary at this point which provides me with little to no incentive to ever return to my studies ever again. \n\nAs great as all of that sounds, new job opportunities are scarce (and often seem to be discovered via connections I have rather than through recruiters who don’t seem particularly useful) and I can’t help but feel quite insecure as a result.', ""Honestly, I do not think that completing the qualifications did much for my career other than the increments of course. I think in traditional actuarial roles, the FSA/FCAS title holds more value?\n\nAnyway, I think at the end of the day, it is just a job to earn dough back for the fam, if you are getting paid more than other credentialed actuaries, it sounds like going back to study isn't even needed for you at this point :)"", ""> How do you feel about not being able to easily get a traditional role of similar level of seniority plus not having much employment opportunities in the actuarial software space? \n\nIt kinda sucks because there are a lot more higher level roles for traditional work than what I do. As far as a backup plan goes, I have a few open-source projects/software that I think can get quite good if I had the luxury of time to work on them due to being unemployed. I will then email them to every chief actuary in the nation asking if they'd like to bring me on to build up similar projects in-house.\n\nIf that fails, probably just fall back to predictive modeling (either manager or IC).

Some people tell me that you should try to pass as many exams as possible during college, because it makes you competitive for entry level jobs, it’s good to get them out of the way when you have more time, etc. However, other people (specifically, my manager at the company I’m interning at) are really encouraging me to NOT take any more exams during college. My manager’s reasoning is because recruiters might look down upon the fact that you spent a lot of your time in college studying instead of “having fun” (kinda like, did you even do anything other than study) and that you only get one time in college and that you should enjoy it. Additionally, if you pass too many exams it might deter companies from hiring you because your exam knowledge exceeds your practical work experience.\n\nI guess I would appreciate some clarification if I should actually try to pass more exams during college. I have two more years left, so it feels kind of like a waste if I don’t. I have no reservations about pursuing the CAS track. My study schedule would be pretty lax, allowing myself like 6-8 months to prepare for MAS-I. I don’t feel like it would drastically affect my ability to “have fun” or be social, nor do I think it would negatively affect my studies. But maybe that’s just me being naive.

Many times, offshored work is low-quality and requires more time to be fixed, but it\'s still happening at a fast rate because many big companies would rather pay for cheap work and have a few accountants check that work.

I\'m just saying the most common argument for A.I. ""replacing"" workers doesn\'t rely on them having to *completely* be able to do everything a worker can.', ""I think they will. The credential requirement will of course persist, but how useful is that, really? The future of labor that I see is multitudes of AI agents doing the grunt work, with a handful of human reviewers at the highest qualification levels reviewing that work and signing off on it. And at the end of the day most actuaries are at an IC level and not signing off on anything. It is a natural result of how teams are structured - one higher level manager directs multiple lower level ICs. The next evolution of computer work will cut out the lower level ICs.\n\nModels will get better, they already are good enough to pass high-level mathematics competitions and create proofs. They haven't had the multi-agent flows and effective tool use built around them yet. That is 2-10 years down the pipeline depending on who you ask but it'll come. The AI agent will have the ability to communicate with other AI agents, search the Internet and internal databases, operate the computer, and code on the fly to create deterministic solutions where necessary.\n\nEven if you limit things to an 8%/year job loss rate, which is historically the absolute fastest any individual occupation has shed jobs due to automation, that is still destructive in terms of wages considering supply of jobseekers won't be going anywhere. Media has gone through this for years, there has been a trend for years of newscasters and magazine editors switching to marketing and communications jobs because their previously lucrative news jobs suddenly started paying less. Low level bookkeeping clerks and customer service reps are next up. I don't think it's safe for prospective FSAs to assume they will be able to move up to the 200k jobs with so many headwinds visible, especially when the profession tilts so young and we can expect the supply of credentialed workers to increase quite a bit.\n\n[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-the-secret-meeting-where-mathematicians-struggled-to-outsmart-ai/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-the-secret-meeting-where-mathematicians-struggled-to-outsmart-ai/)"", '😭😭😭', 'Tried changing up the title and still keeps getting removed by automod', 'Most actuarial employment is based in other parts of the country.

1. Is this feasible? 
2. Is there enough time to complete the 3 modules by September if I start now and really grind on it? 
3. Are the modules too hard for someone like me who has not taken any ASA module and has only one internship experience? 
4. Is there any pre-reading needed? 
5. For the end-of-module test, we get a set of answers after submission right? And for the second try do we really get the same set for questions? I heard about this but seems a bit too good to be true haha
6. Actually what is the purpose of the self-assesment part?

Thanks! "|"['IIRC, the modules aren’t hard, they’re just boring\xa0', 'What track? I can speak for ILA. \n\n\n1. Yes, my understanding is FSA requirements can be done any time (except DMAC) prior to ASA attainment. \n\n2. Probably, full-time workers can easily get one done in a month in my experience.  \n\n3. The content isn’t difficult I don’t think, but I also have YOE in the industry so not all of it is new. \n\n4. No, all required materials are presented in the module\n\n5. Yes. You have never done modules before but in PAF they cover explicitly that you cannot just submit a terrible assignment to get the answers. You’ll get in trouble with the SOA. You should actually attempt the module and give it complete effort. It’s not a guarantee that the second exercise will be the same if you self-fail, but I’ve heard most of the time it is. \n\n6. It’s mainly to show you grasp the concepts. Basically that you don’t just run through the slides and have some understanding of the material. However, as with ASA modules, many people skim the slides and go back to retrieve the proper readings based on the assignment questions. \n\n\nI will say though to me it makes more sense for you to just knock out another ASA requirement.

I never read the PDFs they link unless they seem relevant during the EMA. And you can refer back to anything during the EMA. Not to mention the FSA modules do not have a time limit for the assessment. I’ve heard some people skip through every slide and only refer back to the relevant ones during the assessment.

And they still took me only about 2 months to complete in all. In other words, they could easily probably be completed quicker.\n\n3. Yes, I think so (especially the ILA track)! If you have a bit of work experience and beginner-intermediate Excel skills, you should have no problem.\n\n4. Not for the ILA track.\n\n5. It depends.

I compared the booklet to one from a couple years ago and the numbers haven’t changed at all, and it makes me wonder if they’ve ever been adjusted with inflation whatsoever?

In my experience actuaries are high achieving risk adverse individuals. As a result, actuaries tend to not job hop at a rate comparable to other high paying careers. Look at software engineers, they’re moving to a new gig every two years. Data scientists typically also jump around. This keeps salaries high because they either have to pay more for incoming talent or have to pay more to keep talent from leaving. Actuaries meanwhile stay at companies for decades and those annual COL raises are significantly lower than what they would get if they moved around. If more actuaries were more open to moving to a new company every 3-4 years it would result in the whole industry having to raise pay.', '(1) Salaries in most industries haven’t kept up with inflation and (2) you are comparing a few years in a different industry to entry level.

If exam passes, do you have study hours? If so, actuaries are quite literally paid to increase their salaries (however minimally from a percentage perspective).

That said, I'm not sure why you're focused specifically on exam bumps.\n\nThe only question that really matters is, are you unhappy with your overall compensation package?  I tend to use DW Simpson for example for monitoring my salary relative to peers, which helps guide my opinion.  They have Canadian salary survey results as well.  How does yours compare?

And I’d rather get more experience once I’m no longer studying than spend 10 years or something taking exams and give my all to a job/company that doesn’t care about me outside of work.\n\nIt’s all personal preference though.

Many companies exited the market and by the early 2010s there were something like five companies issuing new LTC polices for a while. There may not be many more selling standalone LTC today, but it might be a sort of popular rider/combo benefit. As far as how they’re doing, I think there is significant demand in the market and they are probably priced relatively conservatively.', 'I’m not actively following the health track, but my understanding is the benefits offered by LTC sold today differs from what was covered on LTC sold 20-30 years ago. Changing the benefits/coverages is just one lever to adjust the pricing risk of the product. And, as ArtLewis mentioned, it’s more common to see LTC as a rider than a standalone product where it’s risk and benefit overlap with a base policy.']

Obviously I failed but my numeric score is a 1. This is a little bit of just an upset post because I knew I was going to fail but I thought I did better than a 1...Even though I expected to fail I still spent a lot of time studying and it feels like a complete waste to end up with the lowest score possible. It feels like all that time was just a complete waste and I can't help thinking of all those times I gave up social activities or relaxation. Ok rant part over though, but if anyone has uplifting words I'd definitely take them. I've never failed an exam this badly so it just feels like a punch in the chest. 

I know what I need to work on. Getting used to the open-ended questions has been rough for me, and there were so many questions where I knew how to start it but couldn't get to the actual answer, so I just need to drill questions for the next couple of months and understand the complete processes. Open to advice though of course on approaches other people have taken if their score shows they're starting from square one basically for their second sitting.

If anyone passed or got really close this sitting and can share what their score breakdown was so I can get a sense of what I would have needed percentage-wise on each section, I'd be really interested. Specifically if you got a 5 or 6 since you would likely be near or at the passing mark. I want to have a good idea of this for next sitting.

Option A: Stay at current company 
- 80k salary 
- Hybrid, 3 Days in office, 1hr commute each way
- Low Stress and low hours, very comfortable with my work and tasks. Feel great about job security. 
- Great Manager and team 
- Great social scene with weekly events and lots of other analysts 

Option B: Leave for other firm 
- 110k salary
- Remote, and if required to go in for any reason, office is 20-30mins away 
- More work and more stress  (was told people wear many hats here)
- potential Manager seems okay
- Upper management Heavy, few people my age/role


Want to get some opinions here. Love where I work but got offered big pay bump elsewhere, the extra money would be nice. It is fully remote so that helps with the commute but comes with more work and less social life. My top priority is trying to pass exams to become an associate. Is it worth it? "|"['Only advice is be honest with yourself and think about whether you’re good at balancing work and exams. Can you commit to putting in the work for this new role? Are you willing to sacrifice other things without impacting your exam progression?\n\n30k increase is substantial. How will that money in the short term impact your life? If it won’t (e.g. single, no responsibilities, that type of thing) you need to compare it to the benefits of exam progression (career mobility and long term salary growth).\n\nAssuming you’re looking to take this actuarial thing to the finish line (FSA/ASA), I generally agree when people say use that low stress for exam progression. Chase the money after you get your letters.', 'There’s always a way to find time to study. You’ll just have to sacrifice other things. 30k up from 80k is a very significant raise. If the work is something that seems interesting, I’d consider jumping', 'ACAS here, been in the field for 5 years; pretty much all remote as I started right before COVID. I will say, remote plus more money is a very hard thing to turn down, but I think a lot of people don’t place enough value on having a good social scene at work; you have an easy workload, a good manager, and a lot of other analysts around. \n\nWould it be possible for you to rent closer to the office? Even with your current commute, time saved at home will be spent wishing you were able to go socializing (at least in my case, lol). Especially in our field, the pay bumps will come with exams, and once credentialed, if you’re not happy with your comp or work, you’ll be able to jump ship.', '110k total comp or just base?

Also important to note, remote jobs that are chill are rare and generally stagnate your growth since you’re so early on in your career. Most remote jobs work you more than on-site/hybrid. More of a generalization though.\n\nDo you feel like you’re growing in your role? If so then the wear many hats loses some value. Some people work better under more formal rotation programs with a set of defined roles. Wearing many hats often means scrappy work and learning a lot at once but never enough depth.\n\nDo you need the extra money? 30k is a lot when you’re making 80k but if you’re continuing to grow in your role, this amount isn’t much in the short term.\n\nI’m playing a bit of devils advocate to jumping but at the end of the day it’s okay if you move and the new job sucks. Your career is a marathon and you’ll find another job, even if you can’t come back to your old one.', ""Jump for fully remote alone.

At your age I’d prioritize the exam progress and the social/networking opportunities. There’s probably a reason you’re looking for a new job but you can still find that at a hypothetical Company C.

It’s also nice to have more financial power early on in life as we’d say as actuaries\n\nOtherwise if you’re more focused on your general early career happiness and development as well as good social life, I feel like you already have a very nice environment, and could stay another 1.5 years while pursuing credentials. I wouldn’t slack on that though since you’re giving up 30k.\n\nPersonally If I had 3-4ish exams, I’d pick A. Get my ASA, then see what they’d offer me as a credentialed actuary', 'Take the money.

Another word for “boring” is “stable”, so if you’re looking for predictable work and good work life balance with the occasional increase in workload from update in regulations, pensions is not a bad place to be. \n\nIs the pension industry “dying”? Yes, but at a rate slower than most people assume. Think about it, companies can move to DC plans and transfer their DB risk to an insurer, yes, but even if all DB plans in the US close today, current DB liabilities will exist until the very last person in the benefit plan dies, which is a very very long time away. \n\nAnd how do people get the idea that people who work in pensions are miserable?

You'll never have a plan big enough to have significant credibility on creating mortality tables. Retirement assumptions are mostly stable, and future benefits are based on fixed formulas.

Work Knowledge: Negative Completion Factors|1|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l864p8/work_knowledge_negative_completion_factors/|BoarMeToDeath|1749579576.0|8|1l864p8|0.57|"How do you deal with negative completion factors? 

I’m struggling to wrap my head around estimating IBNR.  In this example, lag 0-6 containing cumulative claims that’s increasing month to month. Then when claims are close to completion, recoupments begin to outweighs claims experience. Then the estimated IBNR becomes negative. 

Does that make sense? It seems like you’re over reserving then reducing it in later lag periods (e.g. months 6+). Seems counterproductive?!?


Thanks for your help and patience!"|"[""I don't work with reserving too much, but I work with data a fair amount. In a perfect world, sure there wouldn't be negatives. But once patient, insurer, and care provider argue their ways, claim adjustments are almost expected on a large scale. Rx rebates might also be applicable but that I'm not 100% sure how it would look. I also know once in a while we get Rx claims listed as paid before they're even filled so that's always fun"", 'Yes, I’ve seen that during my time in reserving. If the amounts are small (<1% total accrual), and only impact months 6+, I think it’s a non-issue. This is in a short term context btw, longer term is different but from the way you’re talking about it, fairly confident this is short term.\n\nA really good metric to track is how much your accrual is changing month over month. Your accruals for lags 6+ should be fairly stable. If you start to see large swings in accrual estimates 6 months out, that’s when you know you have a problem.', ""you're only overreserving at the beginning if you're not taking into consideration the negative amounts that will emerge later. presumably the reserving method you use should consider the negative claim expectation and lower the original IBNR to account for it. as long as the ultimate incurred estimate remains stable then there's no issue."", 'This happens especially with certain types of data.  Some of my former clients didn’t want to project reversals in any fashion but others didn’t mind.\n\nOne option would be to complete reversals separately (I like to do this as a percent of the original claim levels).', ""this isn't too unusual especially in jurisdictions with prompt pay laws.  carriers in those jurisdictions may have a policy to pay claims immediately and recoup later to avoid penalties.\n\nthe goal of chain-ladder methodology is to calculate completion factors for each incurred month.  if there is a consistent pattern of recoveries (i.e., negative claims) within the claim payments then you will want to capture it in your calculations if you expect it to persist.  if you don't expect it to persist then feel free to adjust them out of your claim triangle."", 'It happens sometimes, for lines such as marine or even property. You can consider those recoupments, recoveries etc. You can cosider making your triangles net of recoupments and then adjusting for recoupments seperately. If recoupments are a regular occurrence, it should definetely be allowed for, else we would unnceassarily overreserve.  \nThanks. Have a nice day', '(for P&C): it depends on the line. However negative IBNR if you are counting everything together can make sense.\n\nOne example is if you have a line where there can be salvage (recoveries) or recoveries due to the potential for subrogation against another insurance policy:\n\n Case reserve for recoveries may be set at a different point in claims settlement than case reserve for indemnity/payments. The team doing recoveries may not even be the same as the people settling the claims to the insured and it\'s assessed much later on after a claim has been settled as far as the insured is concerned. \n\nI\'m not familiar with US accounting standards but in Canada at least case reserve for recoveries may have to be booked as a different category than case reserve for indemnity. \n\n  \nI\'ve also seen a case where it\'s a system thing and the ""IBNR"" is just a correction for what will happen once the claim closes.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons..', ""Overpayment is totally a thing, and reserve can totally be negative if the company has historically shown that they were able to recoup overpayments. Usually we separate out reserves and these recoupable overpayments tho, but it's just a terminology difference.""]"

Take 6U in Fall 2025?|2|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l7ucea/take_6u_in_fall_2025/||1749547743.0|5|1l7ucea|0.75|"Hello,

I got a 2nd fail for the spring '25 exam 6U sitting. This is my 2nd attempt at it and I feel like I was close (expecting a 5 once the detailed grade report comes out). I've never passed an exam on first try and rarely passed on 2nd try. Exam 5 took my five attempts to pass. 

If it were any other time I'd probably just go for it again in the fall since the material is still fresh since I think I was so close. But, my wife and I just had our 5th child in May... so there's a lot on our plates right now. 

I'm not sure if I'd be shooting myself in the foot by taking it in the fall (since we have a newborn) or waiting till next spring (since I may forget a lot of what I just memorized for this past sitting). 

Any thoughts on what you all would do? 

Thanks.

Exam 7 study Strategy|7|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l7qyym/exam_7_study_strategy/|naturalSadist|1749533954.0|19|1l7qyym|0.9|"Hey, can you please share what study strategy should be adopted for Exam 7?

I am using Rising Fellow, and considering buying TIA for the practice questions.

So, what should I do? Should I read all the source papers first, any advice for which papers I should read in detail vs which ones I can rely on the outline and summaries alone?

Should I solve problems in conjunction to reading or should I first speed-run through all the papers to get a basic idea of everything, and then start solving problems and revising papers I didn't understand quite well?

  
Please share what worked and what didn't for you. Thanks"|"['Exam 7 is more practical. Solve as many problems as you can rather than going focussing on the source so much. Understand the source material and practice questions; taking one chapter at a time. You can choose to spend more time on chapters that are important than others.', 'Passed using RF without reading any source. Formula sheets on 7 aren’t as important as other exams - focus more on memorizing the procedure rather than the exact formulas with all the subscripts. (Thinking of Mack’s MSE, for instance.)\xa0', ""Like others have said, 7 is very methodical. I used only RF and what I did was read the manual for a paper, then read/skim the source for it, and then do a few RF practice problems to help solidify my understanding. Do this for each paper and then do a second pass through and properly read the source. Regarding which papers to read in detail, I suggest reading them all in detail maybe except for the ones that are textbook-y (read certain chapters from those in detail).\n\nI found Sahasrabuddhe and Shapland especially difficult so spend time on those. All the best on the exam!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, watch the videos before reading the manual. But the videos are only useful for the initial pass through as the info doesn't stick (at least for me)."", ""This will be my first attempt so I am not answering your question here but explaining my planned strategy.  \n\n  \nI've always done better just getting through the first pass as soon as possible and then just doing as many problems as I can until it sinks in.  \n\n  \nI plan on watching RF videos referencing their manual or the source if there's any confusion and then going through the associated cookbook problems for each paper.  Then just practice problem / past exam questions till I drop dead.  This is similar to the first method below of No\\_Feedback\\_9231.  I know fellowship exams are a different animal but it has worked for all prior exams well, so I won't change it until its broken."", 'Using only RF and passed on my first attempt. Just go w RF and trust RF, you be good to go', 'The TIA practice exams\xa0were extremely easy relative to the real exam. Use RF and study the source material in-depth.', 'My first attempt on Exam 7, so we’ll see how this works, but sharing my strategy for what it’s worth (and for feedback):\n\nI am a huge fan of spaced repetition algorithms like Anki, and have been using it for flash cards for several exams.\n\nThe new thing I’m trying is to create a second deck for practice problems, using the problem types from the RF cookbook as my cards.  Each time a card comes up, I try a problem of that type.  If I complete it correctly, I mark the card as correct, if I mess it up I mark it as incorrect.  This should calibrate over time to more time spent on problems that are harder for me and less time on problems that are easier for me.  I’m not 100% sure what my cutoff will be for partial credit on a problem, but I think my general intent will be 80% right equals mark card correct.\n\nI’m lucky enough to get both TIA and RF costs covered, so I’m planning on following the TIA lectures (I learn better from video and I generally like their thoroughness), creating review flash cards from my notes, and activating cards for both review deck and practice deck as I complete sections in TIA.\n\nGoal is 2hr of TIA video per week starting now, plus whatever is assigned from each deck each day.  If I keep up with that, I should finish TIA videos about 1mo before exam day.  From there, I’ll just keep up with review and practice decks each day and attempt to get through 1-2 full practice exams each week.', 'Ok, I pictured you were using this with the RF problem sets.  Like maybe you have a couple cards with each author (4 Clark cards, 4 Venter cards, etc) and each time a card comes up you do the next problem in that authors problem set.', 'Thanks. One of my queries answered!', 'I also just passed first time using RF only. During my first pass of the material I was surprised how easy it was but at the end when I came to review I was shocked how poor my retention was. \n\nSo I’d recommend deciding from the outset whether to go through it as quickly as possible, accepting you’ll forget most of it, and then start bashing problems and properly learning it on your second pass, or if you aim to really learn the material on your first pass practice loads of the problems before moving on to the next section. But I think either method is fine, whichever suits your style.\n\nEven if you do the latter, when you get to the end you’ll realise that loads of the material is annoyingly similar and it’s easy to get confused between various sections and you only start to realise all the nuances when you’re practicing problems from multiple different chapters at the same time. \n\nIt’s easy to know which paper to refer to when you’re just practicing one paper at a time, much harder when you’re given a problem and need to work out which paper/method they’re asking about.\n\nBecause of the mechanical nature of the exam, bash a LOT of problems. RF has a chart showing all the old problems still relevant to the new syllabus and I think they’re representative of the current exam questions. And RF’s question bank on the new papers on the syllabus was also reflective of the exam.\n\nWarning ⚠️: basically everyone who just sat 7 agreed the paper was much longer than they were expecting and it had more problems than in the available past papers. So on the day, pay close attention to the number of questions/marks.', 'how much time did you spent studying on this exam?', 'I love Anki and I think using that as a method to determine which areas to focus on for practice problems is a neat idea!  Could you go more into detail on how you’re setting up Anki for practice problems?  Do you have several cards for each paper? I imagine the number of cards per paper should reflect the rough weighting of that section. How many practice problems do you target to complete a day?', 'That’s also an option, and in some ways might be better.  I’m still experimenting, but my current aim is still to align with “get equally good at the entire RF Cookbook”.', ""Thanks! That's really helpful advice there. I think I will go ahead with the first strategy. As I will end up dragging my reading time to eternity if I do it one by one. Rather, I think I will spend more time with the cookbook and practicing past problems, till it sinks in.\n\nAny sections that we should be more careful about? Like taking our time because its easy to get the concept wrong.\n\nAlso, are there problems that are worth doing initially (in case they lay a foundation to later problems) that you can mention?"", 'Doubled up 7&9, ~380 hrs for 7', 'Just using the RF cookbook for the problem deck.  One card for each problem type they have a recipe for.\n\nNo particular target for number of cards per day, just going to let the algorithm decide.  There’s a YouTuber named AnKing, I follow his recommended settings.  There’s a fudge factor, but usually if you get a card wrong it’ll come back in ~30mins, if you get it right it comes back tomorrow.  Then if you get it right again tomorrow it comes back in ~3 days, then ~7 days, etc, until you get it wrong again.  There’s usually a sampling of several cards each day based on what you’re in theory close to forgetting (or still learning).\n\nThe difficult part tends to be finding problems, I end up searching the problem bank for keywords.', 'I think RF have ordered the chapters pretty well so you’ll cover the more foundational stuff first.\n\nPersonally I found any mention of GLMs to be most confusing. I forget the name of the papers but definitely be careful with these. You’ll find that certain phrases like ODP, bootstrap, GLM can sometimes be used interchangeably, sometimes they refer to totally different things. And pay close to attention to how each GLM is specified, e.g. how many alphas/betas. I wish I had some memory tricks but I don’t.\n\nAlso there are so many varieties of residual. RF has a cheat sheet showing when to use each version which I’d keep handy until closer to the exam.\n\nThere’s a paper towards the end which describes retro analysis of reserving methods. When I read it, I thought “ok there are some interesting findings but they don’t generalize outside this dataset so surely I don’t need to memorize the specifics”. Wrong, you absolutely do need to remember the specific findings from the paper even though they aren’t necessarily true in general. \n\nAlso forgot to mention this: RF’s practice problems often require you to know some very complicated formulas. Some of these you do actually need to know but if you look at CAS’s past papers you’ll find that they consistently give you some of these in the question. Usually you need to remember the basic/simplified version but if they ask for the edge case or more general formula it’s usually given in the question.', 'I found that the first 5 or so RF original practice problems go over the core of each reading', 'I’m about to start on Exam 8 and was considering going through the cookbook first, any thoughts on this?']"

Stay or go work at Milliman?|27|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l5ugco/stay_or_go_work_at_milliman/|Nice_Departure8812|1749328331.0|16|1l5ugco|0.91|"Currently, I work in the health consulting industry and I am receiving my ASA soon.

On the flip side, I am worried about working too much at Milliman and not getting enough study time which will delay my process of getting FSA. My current company working is about 40 hours/week(except for MA bids season), while I heard Milliman‘s average is from 50-60 hours per week. I have 6 YOE and will hopefully be a manager next year.

At least you’d get paid a bonus at Milliman…', 'Varies a ton by office and by teams / specialty areas within each office. In my several years I’ve only ever been to 1700+ twice I think.

The 1300 is an example target — if you bill less than that, correct, no bonus. The 40% share can also vary; I know of some practices that do 50%, and the target sometimes is 100 hours lower for students still studying for exams. Billable rate depends on your experience, your exams/credentials and how much your practice can bill clients for your work. Say something like $300-350 for entry level analyst work and then it can vary a lot with experience and FSA and local metro area.

How much you bill per work day depends where you work and the individual as well. In a 7.5 hour day, I usually billed 6-6.5 hours? Maybe 5 if I was doing a webcast or had a slow day.\xa0\n\nThere’s a bit of a personal tradeoff to make about how many hours you want to work extra for more bonus vs investing in studying to get your credentials faster (and command a higher billing rate). But it’s very “choose your own speed”, as long as your team is not extremely understaffed anyway\xa0', ""Seattle's fairly chill as long as you make your boundaries known, management respects that pretty well outside of crunch times like bid season.

I just want to note that this may be common practice (and may be true with Milliman), but is certainly not always the case. I’m a consulting actuary and my bonus is based on overall performance. We don’t have clear billable hour targets and I would guess I am at the lower end of billable hours as a result of being heavily involved in business strategy, running a line of business, etc. and yet I have been getting bonuses well over target based on performance.\n\nAs an aside, I looked at Milliman prior to taking my current position and was told that bonuses can be quite lucrative + there is some long-term upside, but I did not find the base pay to be competitive at all relative to other opportunities and even when looking at total comp, it didn’t seem worth pursuing. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t pursue it, but I would consider a large array of opportunities.', 'All good! I appreciate your info.

Announcing the PAK Study Manual Package for the November 2025 sitting of INV 101 & INV 201|2|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l5tmpp/announcing_the_pak_study_manual_package_for_the/|Colin-PAK|1749326099.0|0|1l5tmpp|0.6|"Hi Everyone,

My name is Colin Lancaster, and I’ve recently stepped up to become PAK’s lead instructor for the SOA’s Investments exams. It is my honor to announce that the PAK Study Manual Package for the November 2025 sitting of INV 101 & 201 are available for purchase. I’ve worked hard to make sure that the study manual provides thorough coverage of the new material, giving you the tools you need to succeed on the exam.

One complaint I’ve seen about our competitors is that their practice questions are too easy and not representative of what you’ll encounter on the exam. The PAK Study Manual has practice questions that help you retain crucial information from each reading. Additionally, the PAK Exam Aid and Test Aid products contain 70+ exam-style problems that will help you make sure you’re ready for the kinds of questions you’ll actually see on exam day. The PAK Exam Aid and Test Aid products are available as part of the study manual package, and they’re also available for purchase separately.

The PAK Study Manual Package includes a second attempt guarantee. This guarantee will give you free access to the updated materials in the March 2026 exam administration (if you do not pass the exam in November 2025). This makes PAK a great choice if you’re concerned about your chances of passing on the first attempt and want to make sure you have access to updated materials at no additional cost for the next sitting.

The PAK Study Manual Package includes the following items:

– PAK Study Manual, which is available now. I have already released a good amount of study materials for each exam, and I will be releasing the rest of the study materials in stages. The final release will be on July 15^(th).  
– PAK Flash Cards (will be released on Aug 11). This also includes a condensed version of the study manual to help you review the material more quickly.  
– PAK Exam Aid (will be released on Sep 15)  
– PAK Test Aid (will be released on Sep 15)

The PAK Suggested Study Schedule and the product samples for INV 101 & 201 are available on the PAK website.

 INV 101: [https://www.pakstudymanual.com/index.php?option=com\_product&view=product&category=18&Itemid=6](https://www.pakstudymanual.com/index.php?option=com_product&view=product&category=18&Itemid=6)

I recommend buying our materials from the FIA Bookstore (https://www.fiabookstore.com/). Throughout your exam preparation process, you’ll be able to ask me questions through either my PAK email address or our forums. I will be checking these each business day for questions and concerns.

If you wish to learn more about how our products stand out from the crowd, or if you have any other questions, please feel free to reply here. You can also email me directly at [colinlancaster@pakstudymanual.com](mailto:colinlancaster@pakstudymanual.com).

Best regards,

I’m tired of slightly tweaking my approach and getting the same results. So I’m going to list what my study strategy has been and hope someone has some holy grail advice. 

1st attempt. Started studying January for the May sitting (4mos). Spent 2 months reading TIA study material. Did 3-5 practice questions for each section as I went. Month 3 was just more practice problems. With last month I just grinded practice exam questions. I didn’t time myself here. I didn’t do the TIA quizzes and there were 2-3 practice exams I didn’t make it through. Made a quizlet with about 300+ terms. My flashcards had formulas and things like “how does IBNR react to changes in reserve adequacy, or claim ratios when using X development method”.
Schedule: Daily 2 hrs in the morning and 2 hrs after work (30mins- 1hr of this just for flash cards). On weekends 4 hrs.

2nd attempt. Since I got a 5, I thought I was right on the cusp and just needed to grind more practice problems with little mistakes. Spent the whole next 3-4 months just doing the quizzes and as many practice questions & exams I could. Clearly this wasn’t enough. Used the same Quizlet from attempt 1.
Schedule: 4hrs per day again.

3rd attempt. I deduced that “grinding” problems was not the solution and that I needed to really really understand material. So I bought another subscription and re-read TIA material. I spent a good amount of time doing of this too (1-2 mos). I went through all the quizzes again (timed myself) and only a handful of exams at the end (in timed-conditions). If there were any tricky areas, I would do a deep-dive on the material and try to understand it. Also switched to Anki instead of quizlet. But didn’t spend much time on flashcards this time bc it was my 3rd attempt.
Schedule: 2hrs per day (I didn’t have work study hours)

Overall, I really focused on calculating indicated rate changes, Reserving, and Off-balance methods, as well as Implementation. This exam is the most like my real-job work which is why it’s even more depressing that I’ve failed so many times. Any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. Please don’t just say “read the source material” unless you truly believe that’s what will make the difference."|"['“Read the source material” is the key.  If you don’t change your habit, upper level exams are just getting harder.  Exam writers don’t write their exam questions based on ITA.  Taking shortcut is a gamble.  In your case, it is 18 months wasted.\n\nStudy aids are fine.  They give you a quick summary and explain things from a different view.  However, their practice questions are generally too simple and straightforward.  Knowing just basic knowledge is not enough to pass exams.\n\nAs for timing, it is the intent to make exam taker feel pressure to finish all questions.  If you know the answer well, you should be able to answer within 3 mins.  If you don’t, you may be able to get the same answer but you need 15 mins.  The extra 12 mins become penalty since you can’t get it back for other questions.  You need to know the point/min pace.  If the exam has 80pts and it is 4 hours, It is 1pt per 3 mins.', 'Yes, read the source material.

If you are barely passing them or finishing just before time is up, or leaving any questions blank, there's room for improvement.

This is the only source material I have ever read seriously more than a skim and I\'ve passed through exam 6 now.\n\nSince you have already taken the exam three times I\'d focus on past released exam questions and really think about the conceptual concepts more. Most likely this is what you are losing points on. For me, the toughest questions were the ""if X happens what happens to your paid/incurred triangle and how does that impact your development factors"". If you are the same, I would think through almost all possibilities as you review. For example, it could be mentioned what happens if claims settlement speeds up but also be able to answer if claims settlement slows down. I can eventually get to the answer just thinking about it, but I just needed to be faster for the exam.\n\nI don\'t know how much any of this relates to your work but thinking through why things are done the way they are, how they would be impacted if you didn\'t do it the way the material teaches you to, and why your company (if they do) does it a different way can all be helpful.\n\nThe only other thing I can add that I didn\'t see anyone else mention was I did my practice in Google sheets just because it matches the spreadsheets you get in the exam the best.

What materials did you use for practice questions?', 'I read very few articles for part 5 and 6.  Passed 5 on second attempt and 6 on first attempt.

What took me to the next level, in terms of preparedness, was grinding the past exams.  \n\n\\- I sat down for \\~12 of them like it was an exam = timer set, same screen resolution as Exam screens, etc...\n\n\\- and then I graded myself **very very strictly** after each exam; read the common mistakes at the end of every question’s solution = important to understand how to structure your answer\n\n\\- I brushed up weak concepts between each successive exam\n\n  \nI think past exams are very important.  By the 10th exam, I was getting a “sure pass” grade (~72%+), while being very stingy in awarding myself the points. \n\nAlso, using BA (and free RF Excel sheets) to really familiarize myself each type of problem, before starting to take the exams, helped.\n\nNext, you need to fight for every point. So, for the qualitative questions, do a read of the text + flashcards (partial excerpts of TIA’s, that I found on Anki, were good).

This will be crucial for time management. You don’t want to write a paragraph if you can write 5 words.\n\n-let’s say you know a formula is a+b+c. You know how to calculate b & c, but forgot how to calculate a. You can just say that you know the formula is a + b + c but you forgot how to calculate a, so you are just assuming that it is ___. Then you proceed with the problem & you’ll probably get 75% of the points on it.\n\n-you’ll get a sense for how much you can deviate from the source wording. Ex: an exam 6 question was “what do the state departments of insurance do?”. There were like 5 things listed in the text, but they gave credit for probably 30 different things that people remembered from their personal work.\n\n-you’ll get a sense of common pitfalls on certain topics.', 'I don’t think you hear me. lol.

Ideally, it is better to use those 5 items from the source material as you should recall them quickly and save time.  You can fall for work experience to get points but usually end up spending more time (writing and thinking) to answer this simple question.  \n\nAlso, if the question asks for 3 items, you list 3 and only the first 3 will be graded.  People think they can just write a page essay and score point.', 'Wow, it’s such a foreign concept to me.

Try to teach it to someone, or write your own summary of it…', 'That goes the same for practice questions.  If you get them right, does it mean you know the topic?  Are those practice questions exactly the same in the exams?  If not, then there is a disconnection that you need to fill in.\n\nPast exam questions can test your knowledge.  The same for the exam you failed, those tough questions in your memory that you know you did not answer correctly should lead you to re-read the source material.  One has to learn from those failures.\n\nAnd I did not say “just” read material.  I said reading source material is the key.  There is a difference.', 'Read it and write your own study aid. Write questions and your own tests with the intent to stump others.  If you start writing them and find you struggle then you dont understand it. If you do, then you can just keep using your hand made study guide and tests.

Since it’s my first upper paper after exam FM, I got the news of my exam results where it’s not what I expected it to be. Woke up three hours before 8am time because I was anxious of the results. It had been happening for the past two days, getting overwhelmed by people expressing thoughts on discord about the release of the exam results. 

Honestly, although it’s my first time taking 5, it felt like a slap in my face where I felt confident leaving the exam room, doubted myself that I could have prepared much more, and not overthinking it. Now, I can’t even see how badly I did.

It just sucks because my peers expected me to pass, and now I don’t know how to break the news to them. Growing up in an Asian environment can be daunting. 

All in all, now I’m just wondering how I should get back to studying 5 for Fall sitting. Perhaps I may start doing flash cards since I have heard people pass after using it. Or just keep doing past year papers until it’s ingrained in your head. Not gonna lie, one thing I have to admit is not doing enough past-year papers (>1 time each sitting) and thought everything’s going to be okay.

Thank you for reading all the way to the end, and congratulations to those who passed. For those who didn’t, don’t give up and you can do this!"|"['Sometimes failing can be a blessing in disguise. Take your time this time studying to fully understand the material, exam 5 is full of the essentials in the actuarial career, so becoming a master of that is important.

It'll be useful to know which areas you struggled in, how close you were, etc.\n\nA couple of other thoughts come to mind.\n\nFirstly, it might not be a bad idea to think about how to expectation-set within your peer group.  I can't speak to navigating an Asian environment, but if you have any peers you share that background with, perhaps they have advice?  The exam path is literally both as long, and as difficult, as a stiff PhD programme, but it can be difficult to explain that to people.  For your own mental health, finding a way to do that might be useful.  \n\nSecondly, speaking personally, I used very few flashcards for Exam 5.  I'd focus on more problems, re-summarizing source material in your own words (closed-book!), and generally aiming to learn rather than cram.  I'd rather take three attempts but know 5 well, than pass it first try and not understand it, which for me, is unique to this specific exam (I've passed through 6 - none of the others fall into this bucket).  As others have pointed out, it's a very foundational exam in terms of actuarial work.\n\nI'm not sure what test prep service you used (if any), but I can speak to TIA's effectiveness for me personally.  If you didn't read source material for your first attempt (Werner & Modlin), definitely do so.\n\nYou'll get there!  The pain will ease and shift with time, replaced by determination.  Good luck!"", ""Exam 5 was my first failure as well. It's a big shift going from MC to written/Excel questions. You have to rethink how you prepare and know what the graders are looking for when marking. You need to do every past CAS problem AND every study manual question/exam AND thoroughly memorize everything on the syllabus. On the exam itself, don't worry about formatting (making things look nice) and be speedy so that you have time to come back to questions you initially skipped on. Good luck on the next sitting!"", 'You did not fail; you made a significant step towards being a successful actuary.

Until now, the set of questions which I messed up are still pretty fresh in my mind.

What I didn’t do is finish the TIA exercises and I only did the RF cookbook a month before the exam. Thought it wasn’t enough for me to score exam 5. As for source, I didn’t really focus on reading thoroughly since it’s all over the places and may be too lengthy (need advice on whether source would be a better reading material, although it may differ for each and every individual). I don’t think I can avoid PCPA at this point but I just want to get over with Exam 5, so that I can start with MAS-I. Primarily the reason why I didn’t read source that much was it was quite overwhelming for me. But looks like I can’t avoid source if I need to pass 5.\n\nI guess I will focus on source more for fall sitting, do correct me if I’m not supposed to start as such.', 'That’s the thing. I’m not sure what the graders want to see. Formatting wise isn’t an issue for me. What im afraid is when it comes to quantitative questions, especially “Show all work”, can’t I just write numbers?

I recalled having 10 minutes more to double check my answers. Material wise, I do use TIA and RF cookbook, but not source. I’m not sure whether I should change my approach by doing an intensive reading on source and let TIA and RF be the refresher.', ""I'd absolutely recommend source material in general.  For upper levels (beginning at 5), it becomes vastly more important than in lower-level exams.  Prep services should be thought of as an aid, not a replacement.  \n\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to firmly disagree with your statement about the value of source material being different for each and every individual.  No prep service for upper-level exams will reliably cover all of the possible questions, concepts, level of detail.  Without source material, points will be left on the table, greatly reducing your margin for error.\n\nOne other thought.\n\nSome of your other comments - about source material being all over the place, it feeling quite overwhelming, wanting to get past 5 so you can start with MAS-I - stood out to me.  It sounds silly, but you should try to be more confident in yourself!  You're capable of this!  It's very much a marathon though, not a sprint.  One exam at a time, and really give it your all - whatever is needed, however many attempts.  You'll get to MAS-I when you get to MAS-I."", 'I think if you show separate columns, that\'s sufficient for getting the points. E.g. have a column for LDF, another for trend years, another for trend factor, then trended losses, OL factor, OLEP, etc. Showing these steps makes it much more likely to get part marks than if you do it in one go. For qualitative, remember each ""point"" you make is worth 0.25 pts. So a ""briefly describe"" question worth 0.5 pts is looking for two brief bullet points to get full marks. You got this in the next one.']"

Any actuaries work at a PBM?|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l2metg/any_actuaries_work_at_a_pbm/|rlxrt|1748982422.0|3|1l2metg|1.0|Title - if so, what's it like? Seems non-traditional, but intriguing.|['I’m working at a PBM right now.\n\nThere’s a variety of roles but I currently do a lot of data analytics for various clients. The work is definitely different than just “pricing/reserving/trend/risk adjustment/whatever” that you might get at a traditional insurer. Various actuaries might work on rebate strategy, or developing new programs, or underwriting for existing and prospective clients.', 'Thanks - how do you feel the work life balance is being in a non-traditional role? Do you find the work to be fairly routine or are you working on something different every week?', 'So again, this will depend on which role you’re in. For me, I do have routine work that’s done on a quarterly basis, so part of my schedule is just spent refreshing reports/other “boring” stuff like that. But in between those cycles, there’s a lot of opportunities for ~~spending a bunch of work hours studying for FSA exams~~ developing new analyses/unique insights that can be used to help drive change for our clients, and to quantify the potential impact of those changes. So it’s a mix of both on those fronts. And quite frankly, it’s a welcome mix, since after you’ve done a really challenging analysis it can be nice to have something rote and brainless to do for a week or two.\n\nAs for the work/life balance, PBM work has been a sweet spot for me in terms of getting to do client work (sort of like a consultant would do) without having to put in consultant hours. There’s occasionally crunch time around a client deadline where I have to work OT to get something over the finish line, but it’s not a constant and there are also “dead times” as well that can be good for refining skills, working on long-term projects/innovation, or exam studying.']

This is a tough one and there's a lot of different strategies because you have to get around the automatic filter and then the eye test as well.  I would expand on your recent work experience and remove the experience from almost 10 years ago, unless you want to expand this section and focus on the managerial accomplishments.  Focus on your transferable skills, instances where you contributed as part of a larger team (or projects led), and put in numbers where possible.  It's ok to ballpark it, it's better to have some measurable impact on the resume even if it's slightly made up.  \n\n2)  Interview - Here's where you need to sell yourself.  People you are competing against are going to have different experience than yours, and many firms prefer to hire people with that experience.

How do consultants make commission?|14|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l13m3i/how_do_consultants_make_commission/|TrafficDuck|1748821832.0|7|1l13m3i|0.85|I was wondering how actuarial consultants make their commission. Do they it based on how many projects they work on and get a %. Are they just getting paid extra for billable hours? Or how are they compensated? |['They have a salary.', 'I don’t know of any firm that directly pays commissions to its employees…they are salaried (at *generally* a lower level than a commiserate employee at an insurer), but *generally* have very, very large bonuses. I worked for a consulting firm for the first 3 years out of college, and my first bonus, cut in half because I joined in June, was 3x higher than my stated target bonus. I left that job because I detested the work I was doing and saw very little future for my development….but man was bonus season a blessing.', 'We make a percent of commission for generating sales at a certain level. A lower percentage for reselling work and higher for new sales (think 1%-3%ish). Commissions are split between the people who sell, so it’s not uncommon for a higher level person to contribute a slide or two and then argue that they get half the payout even if you’ve been working on the sale for 6 months.', 'I’ve never seen it paid as commission. With that said, bonuses are usually based on a combination of sales and billable hours.', 'If youre an equity partner / principal then you get a portion of your billable. If youre a grunt, most likely youre not really getting anything other than your bonus. Sharing in the profit margins of the engagement usually comes at a pretty high level (close to or at equity partner level)', 'Do they get nothing on top of it?', 'They can get a bonus based on billable hours. \n\nCommission is more for people who bring in business, not those who work on projects.']
Exam PA: Actex or CA?|7|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1l1187e/exam_pa_actex_or_ca/|nomad_96|1748815297.0|17|1l1187e|0.77|"I have studied for my previous exams using CA - because I have preferred videos over reading, and apparently CA has also revamped their Exam PA content. 

On the other hand, I also see people raving about Actex being a league ahead.  
  
Can the right people give their viewpoints, and help me make an informed decision between the two.   
  
Also, my work is paying for it so money is not the discriminating factor.  "|"[""Thanks very much for considering using my ACTEX PA manual! Written by an instructor who has experienced the PA exam first-hand, the manual is a tried-and-true resource that has helped thousands of PA candidates to prepare for the exam effectively and efficiently since 2019.\n\nI wanted to point out:\n\n1. The PA manual is part of a [bundle of study material](https://www.actexlearning.com/exams/pa) we offer for Exam PA. Besides the study manual, the bundle features additional products designed to suit the needs and learning preferences of different students, including: (1) Instructional videos; (2) Graded mock exam. In the instructional videos, I will use my **less-than-sexy (sorry :D) voice** to walk you through different chapters of the manual and make the materials as accessible as possible. Some of these videos will be reworked in the next few weeks to better coordinate with the latest manual (13th edition).\n2. The [preface](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LP_uYKvRGY5zCozBaAzW_R475jmUSNZC/view?usp=drive_link) of the manual contains important information not only about the manual (e.g., its structure, unique features), but also about Exam PA in general (e.g., what is Exam PA like, the recommended amount of study time). The information there will be useful regardless of your ultimate choice of study materials.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to let me know if there are any questions."", ""Either you can use what works for everyone else (actex) or gamble with ca's revamped material. The choice is yours. Only time and effort at stake. And honestly, we have so much youth in our lives it's fine if some of it goes to waste. \n\n\n(Took 9 weeks to study for PA, got an 8 with actex. Used CA for every other exam)"", 'I never used CA to study for PA, but ACTEX made it incredibly easy. CA may be just as good but ACTEX is a very good, very safe option.\xa0', 'actex’s free cheat sheet is enough if you’re feeling brave, don’t have lots of money, or are on a huge time crunch\n\nbut yeah actex full manual is really good', 'I failed PA thrice before getting a pass for last April 2025 sitting. I have used ACTEX for my first three attempts: Grade 4 , 5 , 4\nThen last sitting I used CA, I gotten a grade 8.', ""I got a 5 with Actex outside of busy season, and a 7 with CA during busy season and sat 3-4 weeks before my wedding. Video lessons aren't needed but if you really want to rely on them, CA is approximately 1000x better"", 'Probably in the minority here, but I found the updated CA stuff to be helpful. That being said, I definitely went very slow with the videos, and took notes and then reviewed the notes and asked questions if I still had any, then did the concept checkers to make sure I had the conceptual part down.\xa0', 'CA is the move!', 'Here are a few aspects of ActEx’s PA that  I\'m not particularly a fan of and you might want to consider.\n\n1. Language and Style:\nThe language of the manual employs a complicated style that, while precise, can feel unnecessarily verbose.\nFor example, words like ""pertain,"" ""innocuous,"" ""obviating,"" ""perturbations,"" ""albeit,"" ""pedagogical,"" ""versatile,"" ""nomenclature,"" and ""peculiar"" are used accurately but likely do not belong to the everyday vocabulary of practicing or aspiring actuaries.\nAdditionally, the sentence structures are sometimes overly complex and might be rephrased for quicker comprehension. Compared to the math-related textbooks encountered during undergraduate studies or throughout the SOA journey, ActEx’s PA stands out with its unique stylistic choices. While the content is excellent, presenting it in a clearer, more accessible manner would reduce the extra effort required to process it.\n\n2. PDF Accessibility and Viewing Experience:\nThe manual does not offer a downloadable PDF option, and the provided PDF reading platform “Eureka!”, across web, mobile, and desktop is disappointing. The viewing experience suffers from limitations in search functionality, annotation tools, and even the ability to copy text. While these restrictions are likely intended to protect intellectual property, they raise concerns about long-term access. Once the license expires, any annotations or insights you’ve made might vanish. This is in stark contrast to traditional online book purchases, where a downloadable PDF remains available for years, ensuring both reference and review at your convenience. Such decisions seem to prioritize business considerations over customer experience. There are, of course, workarounds available if you have some coding background, but often end up consuming valuable time and extra effort that could be better spent on the material itself.\n\n3. Communication Style:\nOccasionally, Dr. Lo’s tone on Discord or Reddit may come across as curt when he is frustrated, but this appears to be his natural communication style in English. His intentions are genuine, and over time you may find his approach more relatable.\n\n4. Support on Discord:\nAlthough ActEx promptly transitioned from a channel setup to a forum on Discord back in 2025 Feb, it still feels disorganized.\nThe search function is counterintuitive, you can only search by post titles, not the content within posts. While an alternative search method exists, it’s extremely inconvenient, especially on mobile devices.\nAdditionally, there’s no clear guidance on how to create a post, such as a standard reference system for manual pages, specific topics for PA materials, or past exam questions; this omission makes it harder for future candidates to find related discussions and increases the likelihood of repeated questions, which ultimately adds to Dr. Lo’s workload.\nFurthermore, while Discord support initially seems accessible, Dr. Lo often becomes overwhelmed, particularly near exam dates. As a result, several posts dating back to before April remain unanswered, likely due to the platform’s limitations in tracking and managing follow-up questions rather than any deliberate oversight.', 'Real', ""What did you prefer about CA? did you use it after the revamp? I passed using ACTEX but I'm just curious"", ""Used CA for April 2025 sitting. The video lessons were made to be like actual presentations instead of just screen recordings. The whole user interface was preferable (standard CA breaking out by section instead of actex just giving a long pdf that I found to be absolutely daunting). I found actex to ramble a lot too.\n\nTwo smaller things that irrationally bugged me, the use of emojis throughout made it feel like it was written by someone in junior high, and I dont even know how many times Prof Lo pointed out that he sat for a given sitting. Than the massive ramble about a reddit user/post is just a waste of everyone's time. \n\nI think Actex had end of chapter questions then just told you where to find the answer within the manual, CA had the same but actually gave you answers. I preferred this so you could be confident you had all the pertinent info without anything extra. \n\nI believe Q&A has been redone for Actex but it was an absolute mess previously. Just one long discord channel for questions about the entire manual. Compared to CA which has the Q&A at the bottom of each section page."", 'Hello!\n\n>I dont even know how many times Prof Lo pointed out that he sat for a given sitting\n\nLet me count this for you. It is, to be exact, **TWO (2)** in the core of the manual (pages 132 and 352 in the 12th edition), which is about 600 pages long. I reduced the number of times after [someone made a ""complaint,""](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/15xma98/dear_ambrose_lo/) but if this still proves distressing, perhaps I need to reduce the number to 1.\n\n>Than the massive ramble about a reddit user/post is just a waste of everyone\'s time.\n\nExercise 4.1.12, which discusses common misconceptions about residuals in a GLM (raw vs. deviance residuals), is 2.5 pages long, and 2 pages there are devoted to purely technical discussions. It is actually a highly educational exercise as it illustrates important concepts tested in past PA exam questions and going through it is by no means a waste of time.\n\n>actex just giving a long pdf that I found to be absolutely daunting\n\nThe bookmarked manual is clearly broken down into chapters, sections, and subsections, and students are free to navigate and read at their own pace, possibly with the help of the online scheduler.', ""That side story actually helped me remember that part of the lesson.  It would be a mistake to remove it.\n\nI've seen multiple manuals reference the author taking the exam.  For instance, the Edge manuals for retirement FSA exams pitch their content because it was made by an actuary who took and passed the exams.  Its not just the PA manual.\n\nI also used Actex during my busy season (spring 2023) and even stopped studying for a month due to work commitments.  Still passed PA and its only because of the manual.  I actually found it, by far, the most well organized manual for any actuarial exam I've taken."", ""Don't listen to this hater Mr. Lo. I actually found the emojis and light-hearted bits quite entertaining, makes the studying process more fun. I also thought it was a good idea that the end of chapter questions point to the sections where you learn the material, so rather than memorizing the answers, you go back and learn to understand it. And of course, doing practice exams and comparing your answers to soa answers will improve the scope of your responses, if that's a worry to this student. Conveniently, those exams and solutions have their own section in the ACTEX manual! \n\nI also appreciated you mentioning you've done this exam before, certainly reduces any doubt on how relevant some sections are. I was able to fully put my trust in you, and that rewarded me very well!\n\nAlso, kind of hard to say that CA is better because this student passed using it if it was also their second attempt. I'd assume a PA passer, especially with multiple attempts, would consider multiple explanatory variables for such a logistic model. Perhaps no study material can aid them in internalizing such a concept, so I question their blame on ACTEX alone. \n\nI'm also guessing this student didn't do the mock exam, perhaps thought to use the first sitting as the mock instead😄."", ""Thanks very much for your encouragement. The real battle experience of an author is indeed an asset as it can make sure the author understands what the real exam is like and writes the manual from an exam taker's perspective, not as an outsider.\n\nI'm really glad my manual helped you make it through PA (about 2 years ago!) rather easily. All the best in your future endeavors."", 'I really appreciate your kind words! We all know how boring and painful studying is, so those emojis\xa0are meant to add some fun and personal touch to the manual. I cannot for the life of me see why the emojis can be distressing or a hindrance to learning.\n\nLet me take the chance to thank you for using my PA manual (and the graded mock exam). I hope it has made the whole exam journey easier and more enjoyable, at least slightly. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors!']"

thinking TIA is better for upper level exams but worried about the transition to a new platform, I have used CA for all exams so far"|"['Rising Fellow (RF) is also great for CAS exams.', ""As others have said, it's more about the transition between lower-level and upper-level exams.\n\nI didn't feel the structural changes were difficult to navigate.  For disclosure, I haven't followed the typical route - I went P / FM / IFM (CA), jumped to 5 (TIA), then went back for MAS-I / MAS-II (CA), and am now awaiting results on 6 (CA, and, please, let those results be good...).  \n\nThe loss of CA's Adapt system is the most notable change, but that loss feels natural enough considering how exam formats shift between MAS-II and Exam 5 or higher.  TIA's flash cards felt like the right replacement.\n\nI should also add, I'm not a video person, and didn't utilize those as frequently.  For CA, I found they added no value at all, as they essentially just regurgitated the reading (which is fine for those who prefer video formats, to be clear).  TIA's videos will occasionally contain additional detail or thoughts to help clarify certain concepts, but I didn't find any of it essential, especially if you read the source material as well (which I'd highly recommend).\n\nAll that to say - I wouldn't worry about the platform.  You'll get used to the new one quickly enough."", 'I’m going to be blunt, the choice of study material shouldn’t matter much.

While most find their success in TIA, etc., because the FSA exams are just so different, there are a few, like me, who find other ways to be more effective for them. For me, that’s reading the actual sources of material (I know, it’s much more reading, but hey, it works). Try to find out what works best for you. At the end of the day, it’s all about trying to retain as much of the content as possible. Good luck!', 'I used TIA for exam P and liked it way better than CA', 'I used TIA for all exams (ASA and FSA) and I have no complains', 'Definitely a transition that takes some time getting used to. Allow ample time for this while studying. \n\nLike Dave, Eddie is a great instructor.', ""The initial study period is almost identical, in that they have both video lectures and text sources for you to learn from. At this stage, I think the hardest transition is just in the format and difficulty from lower level to upper level exams, because its a massive jump and i doubt even staying on CA would do much to soften that transition.\n\nThe biggest platform specific difference is going to be in your review period. There are no quizzes, no adapt system. There's no test bank to repeatedly practise as much as you want, and no immediate right/wrong with detailed feedback. All you have are past exams and the model solution (with some TIA commentary to supplement the SOA's).\n\nOn top of this, you cannot ask as many questions as you would on CA. There are far fewer staff who respond to forum questions, which not only means to expect slightly longer response times, but closer to the exam date they will always (in my experience so far) implement a triage system for forums where they prioritize students who have asked fewer questions so far as I understood it. Because of this you will want to try and shift your study schedule earlier to get questions in before that period starts, or otherwise you might want to consider rationing your questions to only the most critical."", 'what did you use for exam 5?', '^^^ I think TIA is great.  you just have to get used to absorbing a lot of information opposed to the arithmetic grind that are the prelims', ""Thanks for your feedback, but I just wanted to clarify some facts.

I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm 35 years old. I qualify for a critical illness accelerated benefit through my life insurance. I've submitted the claim/papers/forms required. They got back to me today and they have applied a 98% actuarial discount on my death benefit. 

For full acceleration, the death benefit is $538,000 and the actuarial discount is $526,000

For partial acceleration, the death benefit is $513,000 and the actuarial discount is $501,924.27

"|"[""Benefit Payout = PV of Death Benefit - PV of Future Premiums - small admin fee\n\nFor PV of Death Benefit, insurance company will first underwrite your claim info and assess severity level.

So, PV of Death Benefit won't be a big number after mortality discount.\n\nFor PV of Future Premiums, if your policy is less funded, then expected future premiums will be higher. Since your have an IUL and it's a few years old, I assume the cash value is relatively low. So, PV of Future Premiums will be a big number after interest discount.\n\nLow PV of Death Benefit - High PV of Future Premiums - small admin fee. This means a small benefit payout.

Feel free to pm me if you need more understanding on this or any other help.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't claim this payout amount for now.

I have recently completed my ASA, and always thought of making this decision at the very end, and now when the time is here, I just can't seem to take a decision.

So I have been working at a P&C Company for the past 4 years, mainly Health and Motor. I would like to continue the niche in the future as well. 

Now, the problem lies with the credential. Should I pursue FSA with non-life track (which we all know is incomparable with FCAS and holds less value) as I do have plans of moving abroad in the future (currently in middle east). Or should I pursue the health track of FSA and have some sort of saving grace? Can't do life track as that completely differs from my interests and goals.

I am really confused as to what I should do as it's too late for me to start the CAS journey. Please pour in suggestions. Let me know if any of you have had similar journeys that worked out in the future.

Thanks!"|"[""It honestly does not matter what you pursue your FSA in, I was actively taking life exams while working in a Health role, no one cared.\n\nAs for whether you should pursue your FCAS or your FSA, that's a whole different story.

PA or FAM after SRM|13|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kywc62/pa_or_fam_after_srm/|Rubberducky_ate_pi|1748582863.0|8|1kywc62|0.89|"Hey guys,
I am fortunate enough to pass SRM this past sitting. I am debating which exam to take next. I am currently a third year college student and if money isn’t an issue I’ll definitely take PA first. However, it seems like most people do PA and then ATPA consecutively, which are both pretty expensive. On the other hand FAM seems to be more actuarial/insurance related. Since SRM is mostly conceptually I think I can remember the overall ideas and come back to PA later.

Anyone in similar positions? "|"['PA is generally considered easier than FAM and also has way less material to go through. Given that the SRM material is still fresh in your mind, PA should take you even less time to study and be much easier to pass overall. You can then use the extra time you have (since you will spend much less time studying for PA than FAM) to work on your excel skills. Improving your excel skills (and maybe learning a bit of SQL or any other programming language the company you are doing your internship at) will be more of a deciding factor of whether you get the job or not as opposed to any knowledge you’ll learn from FAM. \n\nIdeally to maximize your chances of passing your exams on the first try with the least amount of effort, you want to follow this order from left to right:\n\nSRM -> PA -> ATPA\n\nFAM -> ASTAM/ALTAM\n\nIt’s true that PA is much more expensive than FAM. But think about how much more your time is worth, as studying for PA would give you more time to learn excel and a programming language which can help you stand out in your internship.\n\nAlso if you planned on getting coaching actuaries for FAM complete package currently priced at ~$504 (with student discount) then you can think of the cost of PA being offset by just needing to buy the Actex Manual for PA which is much cheaper than that. Even if you are used to CA, I think trying Actex for this exam should be fine because most of the material would just be a review for you since you just passed SRM.\n\nAlso check with your employer if they are willing to refund the full cost of PA or at least partially (cost of signing up and materials needed).', ""PA is basically applied SRM. It's best to take that one while the SRM material is fresh in your mind. FAM is a brutal exam to study for, feels like studying for two exams at once. I'd recommend taking PA if you can afford it."", 'Do you have a reason to be more inclined to go for an “actuarial/insurance” related exam?\n\nIf you’re already employed, then your employer shouldn’t care which exam you’re going for. They just want you to complete exams. \n\nIf you’re looking for an internship/full-time job, same principle applies. Employers just want to see that you’re committed to and writing exams, whether that’s P, FAM, or ATPA. \n\nI would go for PA and ATPA. Leverage the fact that SRM is still fresh in your mind, so you can shorten the study time for these two exams.', 'If you are able to pay the 1200$ fee for pa right now without it being too painful an expense the id say do that, and even if it’s tight I would say it’s worth it to take the exam now while it’s still fresh in your mind since it basically covers the same stuff as SRM. \n\nIf it would be a significant financial burden though then I’d say go for FAM now and wait to take SRM until you can hopefully have the exam expenses covered by an employer, as FAM is more like 300$ (at least when I took it)', ""I'm in the same boat. Thinking of going with FAM since a lot of the concepts I’m coming across at work relate to it and I want to understand them better. Another reason is that PA is just too expensive for me right now.\xa0\nBest of luck with your prep, whichever path you take!"", 'Thank you for your thoughtful comment. The extra time argument makes a lot of sense. I will take PA next.', 'I have an internship for the summer and I think the insurance related concepts can help me understand the actuarial profession better and maybe improve my odds of a return offer.

AI for studying|6|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kyuxpd/ai_for_studying/|MissionPanda2431|1748577844.0|20|1kyuxpd|0.64|I took the last 3 exam cycles off after a couple failed attempts at my first FSA exam.

AI is no substitute for putting in the work. It basically just boils down to who does the most practice problems and exams under timed conditions. The KISS principle applies here.\n\nOn the job, it can be useful, but for exams, it's mostly detrimental since using it reduces the amount of active recall from your brain. For example it's always better to write your own summaries and notes than it is to have AI do it."", ""I found it very useful while studying for ERM. I downloaded the source material and fed it to ChatGPT. It did an excellent job providing study notes and summaries. I loved having the ability to ask it for examples of some obscure topics. You can further ask it to generate sample questions in the appropriate format after feeding it some past exams and case studies. It also provides excellent feedback on responses and suggests improvement.\n\nLots of people attempt to use it without first uploading the relevant source material or using prompts that force it to refer to the material which leads to mediocre responses. But if you use it well, it's a powerful study tool."", ""There's plenty of AI usage on The Actuarial Nexus to study for prelims. To give a sense of usage, there's typically around 3K API (chat) requests per month, peaking at 19K in April 2025. So there definitely are people using AI.  \n  \n\\- Initial implementation was mainly using AI as a solutions interpreter for practice questions (i.e. you can ask AI about practice questions). The general feedback I've gotten on AI is positive, but there may be confirmation bias, since positive feedback is more likely to be shared with me than negative feedback, and the platform might attracts candidates who are more open to using AI.\n\n\\- Recently, AI was used as the centerpiece of the automated grading system for Exam PA (hence the peak in April 2025). I made a post about expanding this service to FSA exams for Fall 2025. This added significant value for many candidates, as publicly noted in the actuarial exams Discord server and through private DMs.    \n  \nGiven the other discussions around AI on this subreddit, the general sentiment I get is that there's a lot of hesitation around using AI to study for exams.

I often found mistakes, but mostly it was a positive experience and I plan to use both for my last FSA exam this Fall.', 'maybe AI can be helpful for studying? but this just screams that you are looking for a short cut or a magic solution to help you pass.  I think your time would be much better spent focusing on the areas you were weaker on as well as FSA exam answering strategies. \n\nI could be way off, but your mindset just doesnt seem ideal for what is required with these exams.  While not perfect, the study materials offered by the main companies are what nearly everyone uses and by trying to take a less traveled route you risk putting yourself at a disadvantage, not advantage.', 'This is an interesting thread.

It's not all COVID's doing, either.  The fact that students are using a number of LLM tools doesn't mean they're actually helping.\n\nWhere LLMs today would be most useful is creating the sort of summarized study materials that different test prep providers offer (e.g. Coaching Actuaries).

It can be good since you can explore different teams and different work, HOWEVER having a good rotational program depends on having good managers all around (which isn’t always the case). Also, constantly moving teams means you are essentially a “new hire” multiple times as you learn the different work, which may or may not delay getting a promotion depending on company. In other words you get a lot of different experience, but not enough in any one thing to be trusted to manage. But every company is different', 'they are probably nice for exposure, but I think it actually puts a lower ceiling on short term growth speed relative to a non rotational role', 'Not a fan.

Some lines the projects are annual so half the rotations would never get to experience it.', 'at what point in an actuaries career does specializing typically occur? once they obtain ACAS?', 'I echo this. Except typically you get promotions based on exam+job+rotation performance as opposed to just job performance. Some positions/teams/roles are more siloed than other actuarial work and you could legitimately spend 6 to 12 months just learning intricate and complicated systems when the rotation is only 18 to 24 months. In theory, the person who learns most does rotate naturally when they are strong enough and exposed enough to their current position, but this mitigates against people being to comfortable in a role for too long', ""Can't expect having good managers all around. Working with different managers, potentially not good ones is part of the learning process. Stick it out and learb what you can or look to jump ship if you don't think it's worth it. More pros than cons IMO, keep things fresh, allow cross pollination of thoughts, learn different functions or business.

This occurs for any practice site given enough practice exams/quizzes, though). For PA, I thought ACTEX felt much more like a guide than a course if that makes sense. Lots of incorporating previous exam questions into concepts as you are learning, and really helpful formula sheets and end of chapter questions.

Prophet Job Setup - Question|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kyaepc/prophet_job_setup_question/|rcz7|1748524233.0|7|1kyaepc|0.33|"Hi! I need your input regarding my Prophet job setup.

Currently, my table setup is as follows:

* `Table Location\Run_01\variable1.fac`
* `Table Location\Run_02\variable1.fac`

The `variable1.fac` table has different values in each run folder.

When I create a job, I currently create one job per run number. If I try to set the run number to `1-2` and use a table location like `Table Location\Run_[Run Number]`, it results in an error because it looks for a non-existent folder: `Table Location\Run_1-2`.

I’d like to improve efficiency by creating one job for both run numbers, if possible.  
Thank you!"|"['Would you be better off setting these input variables to Global and set them there where you can vary them by run number?', 'If these tables are truly just a single variable with a single value, you’re better off moving them into a global table and varying them by run number / column.

For example if you used FILE_NAMES.fac which is essentially a table of tables, the out of the box code would know to pick up the named table u specify for run X and another for run Y.

If you were hired just before, they may have given you the new year\'s salary a few months early and skipped your first ""annual review"" which usually comes with the raise for the year.\n\nDifferent client contracts update at different times. E.g. one of mine was just locked in for the next 5 years, meaning what the client pays for my time is the same for the next 5 years.

If you hadn’t been there long enough when the date came up the first time then the next time you would be considered is an entire year after that. This means that if you get hired 3 months before the magic date, it could be 15 months before you are considered for a merit increase. \nSafest thing to do is to approach your manager and ask how it works without asking for a salary increase.

If you were getting annual raises but no promotions without job hopping then that’s not great but not crazy.

I’m a U.S.-based actuarial analyst (consulting background) and was wondering if any of your companies allow you to work remotely from India or China for a few weeks each year — specifically looking for policies that permit short-term international remote work (like 2–4 weeks or up to 30 days).

 - Whether there’s an official policy for this
 - If you’ve done it — how easy was the approval process?

Strategic Management exam (CP311)|16|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kxj6md/strategic_management_exam_cp311/|XP-Steve|1748444120.0|0|1kxj6md|0.9|"For those looking at exam choices, here is a bit to help on **Strategic Management cross-practice exam CP311** and whether it would be right for you. 

Here are a few thoughts on students that this exam would be good for:

* You’ve passed one or two exams already related to your direct line of work – can be any topic – individual, group, retirement, investment, or finance
* You want to build on technical ideas to learn bigger picture strategic, management, company valuation, and decision-making skills
* You want to invest in your longer term career
* You enjoy long walks on the beach :)

Strategic Management is likely the one exam that applies to every FSA student regardless of sequence they are initially focused on.

If you are on the Individual, Group, or Retirement, or Investment sequences and looking to the future to be part of the effort to grow your company or business, this is a good course to take.   If you are on the Finance track, you can build on some of the finance topics you learn with a more strategic focus.

Its not ideal as a first FSA exam as some of the technical information you get from the other exams is really important for early in your career, whereas this exam is likely useful for years 4 to 30 of your career.

 

(This exam is a transfer from the past Strategic Decision Making exam, but it’s dropped 33% of the material - over 400 pages dropped!   I have taught this exam for over 8 years.    XP Actuarial has learned a few tricks for significantly improving pass rates for this exam -with many sittings double other providers.  Our material is ready to go and students have started to sign up.)"|[]

There were some weeks she worked near full time hours though, so she was very flexible.\xa0\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, at direct carriers, they tend to hire independent consultants on a contract basis (more likely to be full time hours for shorter periods of time, e.g., 6 months), and usually someone they’ve previously worked with at a big firm (so they know the quality of their work first hand). So they might not have as much desire for a flexible 10 hours per week type person, but you never know.\xa0\n\nI suspect it would be helpful to market your peer review experience as well since you have 20 YOE; that’s something that may be more valuable at a part time basis (reviewing junior staff spreadsheets and work rather than being the doer yourself).\xa0\n\nAlso a random idea - reach out to the SOA or CAS. SOA is starting to have paid exam graders soon, and they also have actuaries on staff for coordinating with volunteers. Not sure they have flexible hours, but if you can volunteer during some business hours, I suspect the networking would payoff for you.

Advice on final 2 FSA exams|6|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kx1mbu/advice_on_final_2_fsa_exams/|MadicOne|1748386945.0|11|1kx1mbu|1.0|"I have passed all 3 FSA modules + passed LPM in Fall 2024.  

I was originally going to take CP 351 in Fall 2025 thinking it was very similar to LAM.  Now that I see that syllabus has basically become an entirely new exam, I am hesitant to take that one at all.  

I may now take ILA 201 U in Fall 2025, although originally I was going to save that one for last as I anticipate it being the hardest exam of all.  I know the new syllabus is greatly reduced but I am not sure of the difficulty level of the new syllabus vs. old (anyone who’s taken LFM have insight on that?) 

Now, whether I take ILA 201 U in Fall 2025 or not, I still need to choose my “one additional course.”  I’ve basically whittled it down to 3 options (although I am open to hearing other suggestions):

1) CP 351, i.e. continue with my original plan.

2) CFE 101 (predecessor was ERM) – writing skills are my strong-suit and I have heard that can help with this exam.  The upside of this also is I could get my CERA I believe (having already completed the ERM module as part of my 3 modules).  Although I didn’t realize the pass rate for this is all the way down around 40% so that does sort of make me think twice.

3) RET 101 – honestly I just picked this as an option because I see it’s predecessor (RET DAU) has like a 60% pass rate and at this point in my exam-taking journey I’m fine with just choosing the exam that gives me the highest chance of passing.  That said, I have no idea how similar the RET 101 syllabus is to RET DAU.

Anyone in a similar boat?  I know this ultimately my decision based on career and schedule etc. but still any thoughts or advice on what to do from here would be greatly appreciated.

(Note: Another downside for me to taking CP 351 this coming Fall is I would like to use TIA to study for that exam, but the TIA course won’t be released until July and I’d like to start studying right away—which is also what is making me consider taking ILA 201 U in the Fall instead since that TIA course is already available.)"|"[""Anything but the RET track, assuming you are a life actuary.

There’s not enough people taking retirement exams to create demand for someone to make better materials (I know because I’ve considered making materials to sell).

(basically we make sure students have proper questions across the whole syllabus + we found ways to help weed out little answering errors that add up for most students.)   For example, Fall/24 we had 40 students pass out of 52 writing, so that was quite a bit higher pass rate than for students writing ERM.\n\nAlso, the SOA has told exam prep providers they are trying to make all exams a similar level of difficulty such that 101 and 311 are specifically NOT like university course numbers indicating difficulty.\n\nThe caveat would be if you are in an ERM job, very likely CFE101 would be the one to take and generally a higher likelihood o passing as it applies more directly to that work.\n\nFeel free to message me if you want some more sample XP material to make your decision.\n\n(XP-Steve)"", 'That’s correct.

"|"['Generally a good and strong resume.\n\nRemove coursework\n\nAdd more discussion points on your IT engineer role.  This should be your major talking point in the interview.\n\nTutor role can be less wordy.  We all know what tutor is.\n\nBe prepared to explain 95% and 85% accuracy.  This can fall into trap on modeling explanation if you are not good at it.  Might as well not to say the accuracy numbers.\n\nTailor the technical skills toward actuarial role but still keep languages like c++, c#, Java as they are more like “big name”.  What you have is for a backend programmer.  Don’t think actuary knows about Linux?\n\nAnd what programming language should be corresponding to your job experience or past large projects.  Anything that you don’t have a match, I know you only have the book knowledge not hand on experience.', 'I think your resume is in a pretty good position.  You actually have a similar background to what I had when I made my career shift - I had more math and less programming, but a mix of tech, tutoring, math skills, two passed exams.\n\nSome specific observations / suggestions:\n\n* I\'d consider removing your GPA, and would absolutely remove your coursework.  The coursework isn\'t particularly unusual for a CS degree.\n* I\'d emphasize the communication skills that would have been built in your time as a help desk technical and tutor.  You won\'t be performing system updates or resolving routine help desk tickets as an actuary, but you will in all likelihood be translating complex concepts to non-actuarial stakeholders.  Good communication skills are also difficult to teach.  Your second bullet point under math tutor is the sort of thing you should be highlighting more, given your background. \n* I\'d consider simplifying your list of technical skills, and possibly not grouping them.  Listing R and SQL twice, in different categories, feels a little off to my eye.  Similarly, I\'d strip either SQL or MySQL from the Video Rental Shop DB.  Removing your Github link might not be a bad idea either; that\'s not a very standard actuarial thing (though it depends what\'s in there of course).  As another mentioned, stripping things like Linux makes a lot of sense.\n* If you have any extracurricular / non-professional experiences that speak to your personality and values, it wouldn\'t be a bad idea to use a few lines on that, even if it means trimming elsewhere.  \n\nMore generally, your resume has enough on it that you should be able to tailor it to different job postings.  I had a few different ""base"" versions, and I\'d tweak them individually as needed.  Pay attention to what the job descriptions are emphasizing.  You can easily take some bullets away from any one experience, in order to highlight others.  Use that.\n\nI\'d also highly recommend a cover letter wherever possible.  You should use it to communicate why you\'re switching fields.  You majored in CS; your work experience is in line with CS; your technical skills are CS.  What professional itch is CS not really scratching for you, that you think actuarial will?  And, then, what advantages does your more experienced and diverse background provide?  The cover letter should of course be tailored to the position, but creativity, communication skills, an eye for how and when to automate tasks (and the skillset to do it) all come to mind.  I think if you can tell that story well, you\'re going to stand out, and win interviews at the very least.\n\nGood luck!']"

I think the soa will end up giving two answer choices that are very similar to one another (where one is the correct answer), so I usually eliminate answer choices that are very different.\n\n2. The soa will sometimes include contradictions in an answer choices. For example they might say the p-value is .25, alpha, .05, we reject the null. Those can also be eliminated.\n\n3. Sometimes the soa answer will be extremely specific and hinges on one variable or one word, so in a true false question, be very critical but only if every answer seems to be true.\n\n4. If answer choices are given in ranges, and you calculate a value that is way outside of the highest range or lowest range, you probably did something wrong. So redo the calc.\n\n5.

So during the exams if my answers were far greater or far lower, I figured I had messed up and would default to B or D.\n\nFor situations where my answer was within the range of MC options, I would alternate between A, C, E.

I don’t have any previous internship experience, so not sure what I can add to make my resume still appealing to companies.

I just recently decided to go back to school after time off working and am taking the FM exam in fall and P exam hopefully next spring, and am working full time in real estate particularly in accounting and mortgages, which isn't actuarial work but it's better than nothing and I have to work full time or I can't afford to live, healthcare, family, etc. Given from what it looks like, you've only worked part time in the past, I'd recommend trying to get any sort of job in accounting or finance or data analysis if you can, take anything, even if its not actuarial sciences you can maybe try to work you're way up and get more experience in statistical analysis or pivot into roles that involve that, once in the company, that's what I did, just to gain experience, and knock some of those exams out, you're not going to land a job right now with no exams passed.

You need to knock those exams out unfortunately and you need time for that, you also have no relevant work, internship, or club/volunteer experience relating to finance/data analysis/etc. Best advice I was given was think of a resume like a story, that's why some people change their resumes depending on the job they're applying to, when you're describing what you did at each job, think about what skills would carry over to the job you're applying for, and which ones wouldn't and put those in the description, same with academic projects, clubs, internships, etc, right now, not to sound mean, but your resume is all over the place. What skills do actuaries use? What are the most important skills? Which ones aren't? Adjust your resume accordingly. You just need a good year, work a bit in a related field, knock those exams out, and fix your resume, most people don't land the job they want right out of college you'll be okay, also the job market is crap right now because of the recession if you're in the US, so take the time, you just graduated you'll be okay, you've got this!""]"

A pricing actuary is going to recommend coverage be excluded for something if it would increase rates above a competitive level, and the customer or client will then choose to purchase that product with that exclusion. No one should be considering denial rates as a good or bad thing after that unless the denial is done fraudulently in some way, which is more of an operational issue than anything with product development, actuaries, and even often executives. Executives very rarely encourage fraud intentionally, they may encourage better financial results, and then some middle manager or front line employee says ‘do this shady thing so I can hit or exceed my targets and look good’ and then they do, and then that becomes the target forever because executives see it is an obtainable goal based on the numbers, that employee or manager grows into a new role and teaches it to others about ‘this is what I’ve always done’ and someone says ‘it’s the only way we can hit our targets’ … and then you have a massive problem down the line.', 'In our company the ownership of the claims denial ratio kpi is shared between product development, marketing, and claims.

I just came to Vancouver, Canada not long ago and landed on a Pension Actuarial Associate job . I used to work in life insurance for two year-ish full time and another one year as an intern also in life.

I have passed all ASA exams and ILA LPM exam. I havent reached ASA since I still have FAP outstanding.

Currently my pay is around 80000 CAD/yr which I think I am substantially underpaid and it was perfectly clear that my current employer didnt take into consideration of my fellowship exam since its on life track instead of retirement track. I felt like my effort is wasted. After working more than half a year in pension, I still feel more comfortable with life and prefer the life work more. Working in DB plan consulting is a bit worrying as most companies right now are offering DC plans to their employees and in the future it may come to a point, where there are no more DB plans to consult on. Any insights on the sustainability of pension consulting job, and if I choose the pension path would a CFA help in case there is no more DB actuarial consulting I can switch to DC investment consulting?

I have tried looking for life jobs in Vancouver but it is really limited. I got one life interview for a possible remote opening with company based in Toronto but didnt manage to get. I have my family together here in Vancouver and moving to Toronto would be my least preferred option.

Would you guys suggest me:

1. Suck it and go down the retirement path. My main concern is Pension Consultant base salary seems rather low and I do not know how much bonus out of projects usually consultants make.
2. Wait for life opportunities to pop out in Vancouver. Opportunities are limited and chance of getting those jobs remotely seems slim. Feel free message me if any of your company is hiring a life actuary position.
3. Move to Toronto. There’s limited career future in Vancouver even if you get a life job.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or sharing."|"['I think the first thing you need to do is get FAP out of the way and get your ASA as soon as possible.

Given the FSA exams being shorter starting this fall, how will this affect total study hours? Should we expect to study the same amount or less?

I just recently attended the APC and am trying to start planning for my FSA journey. 

Let me know your thoughts. "|"['I will take into account information from the SOA and the study material vendors whenever it’s available, but I plan to study a very similar amount to what I would have before. I am hoping my company won’t try to reduce work hours based on the exam being 2.5 hours of content.\xa0', 'I would expect to study the same amount. I’ve only looked at the GH syllabus changes, but it doesn’t look like the material is getting noticeably shorter. It’s certainly far more than half of the content that was in the 5 hour exams just a few years ago. And it’s always better to over study than under study.', 'Keep in mind that with exam is now 50pts and 3 hours each, that translates to 3.6min/pt compared to 3min as before. All else equal, seems reasonable that the SOA would expect slightly better prepared answers from candidates (assuming pass rates remain more or less in the same range).', 'Not truly related to your post here but needed to post this somewhere looking for advice: I passed all 3 modules and then passed LPM last Fall, and was originally going to take CP 351 this coming Fall thinking it would be similar to LAM. Turns out it’s an entirely new syllabus. Now I’m considering taking ILA 201 U in the Fall (was originally going to save that for last). However, I still need to pick my “one additional course” to take. To be honest I don’t care what that one additional course is, whatever it is I just want the highest possible chance of passing. I’m even considering taking RET 101 because it’s “predecessor” was RET DAU which had like a 60% pass rate, but I can’t seem to find much information on how much the new RET 101 syllabus has changed from previous. Honestly I’m just at a loss for what to do now.', 'My company has already reduced the amount of study hours. I feel like that is going to be the most frustrating part of all this because I have my doubts about the SOA saying the exam will truly be 2.5 hours worth of content.', 'I hope they don’t reduce raises', ""Yes I would caution against reducing study time this early. In the last 20+ years, we've seen FSA exam runtimes change a lot: from 6 to 5 hours, then to various mixes of 2, 3, 3.5, and 4 hours. In each case, we saw little difference in when people started studying and how much effort they seemed to put in based on course usage, forum activity, and self-reported study time. There was definitely a difference between the 2 and 5 hour exams, but it was nowhere near proportional. \n\nWith FSA exams, study effort tends to expand to fill the time available. We expect people to spend about the same amount of time preparing as always because that will logically give them the best chance of passing. It's usually better to put in a little extra effort to pass on the first time than risk having to retake. And keep in mind that many exams have a similar volume of content as before. Some like ILA-101 actually grew in size, albeit it modestly. \n\nIn any event, there is more than enough time for anyone taking a fall exam, whether they start now or wait until July results come out."", 'That seems like your company is jumping the gun a bit to me. I guess it depends on the track you go down, but I don’t think the GH exams saw much of a reduction in syllabus. I am hopeful that the SOA will try to fairly represent the syllabus in the 2.5 hours of content, but who knows.\xa0\n\nI never took GH SPC/RM but I had heard from others that it was a comparable amount of content to other GH exams, but fewer questions, so it was to some extent luck of the draw as to what was tested in that sitting.\xa0']"

If your company offers health insurance on a 1,000 cats, then you help make sure that the 1,000 cats give you enough money to take care of them as a collective, with some extra to account for outliers and profit. Rules/regulation can increase risk on your expectation by mandating your offering, you might be told your product has to cover other events/conditions. You made it this far into my post so you already know that ever condition/event/coverage adds a layer of risk to the product, which in turn makes it more expensive, which is why small plans (think even down to just a warrenty for your Nintendo switch) cost so little, becuase only so many things can go wrong.\n\nBut that only describes insurance generally. As an actuary you are basically expected to be the SME for every type of metric associated with this healthy cat product. How much does a cat cost to cover? Monthly? Yearly? Over a life time? What areas affect the cost of care? Its location? The provider? The industry, profession, and market are all established enough that there is data and corresponding methodology for all of that.\n\nEvery layer of risk has date/metrics associated with it that determine that projected cost, therefore actuaries are in charge of using statistics on historical data projected with economic assumptions to predict financial fallout of whatever product they offer/support.\n\nIn recent years climate, regulation, and the market have created/identified new risks, which means more money needs to be offered for every layer of coverage.

I’ve made a post about this situation in the past but I’d love to hear people’s advice about my current situation.

I’m planning to move to NYC relatively soon to move in with my girlfriend. My current company is hybrid, I have no complaints about my job. Relatively low stress, good exam hours, etc.

Well, I got a job offer in NYC that would pay $20-30k more (though not anything insanely impressive considering COL). This company has many benefits as well - study hours, opportunity for growth, etc.

It seems as though my current company most likely will come back and offer me to go fully remote to continue working for them. They may even give me a salary bump. 

Not sure what to do here. I might need to provide more information. Anyone have advice? I’m pretty comfortable in my current role but then again would likely have great opportunities by switching.

Salary bump, new connections and opportunities, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to where you want to be career-wise, and which opportunity matches with that more.

As someone who always considered themselves pretty intelligent, that weighed heavily on me. I have failed exams a number of times, and really struggled with my mental health along the way. I am now one exam away from my ASA, and recently got over a 50k raise due to a competitive counter offer. In my experience, it is ALWAYS okay to take a break from studying, give yourself a chance to enjoy life, and tackle exams when you’re ready. I turn 30 this year and felt I was behind my colleagues due to how long it took me to graduate, but now I’m one of the most well paid. Opportunities will come to you if you work hard and also keep yourself open to growth. One of my coworkers just got his ASA at 35 last year and he’s doing incredibly well for himself now! Everyone’s time table is different, make sure to give yourself a break from time to time.', 'The first thing to do is ensure you are getting yourself the right help. So do that. Forget about the exams; you can always pick them back up or just stick to being an analyst. There is FMLA in the US you can look into leveraging as well as short term disability. You company might also have assitance programs (EAP) to see how it can help. My wife is in compensation and they cant get people to use the EAP and would love to see they are making a difference for people.\n\nYou are not alone and are not helpless even though your mind might say it and your body mighy feel it. In a year today will be a memory and you might have another exam done or switched careers to data science or become a sailor (who knows right?).\n\nBest wishes.', 'An analyst at my work took a LOA recently for a few months.

I found that medication helped tremendously.', ""I was dealing with personal problems and one of them was depression and decided to not say anything until it was too late and fell of the exam program. The only thing I was told is that I should've let them know and they could've pause my exam requirements to stay in the program (at least 1 exam in a year). Your mileage may vary but my company seems trustworthy enough that I really wish I should've been more open with my issues before they had consequences. Also, it helps that it is not unusual seeing Analyst out of the exam program ( however, there is an expectation to eventually go back into the program).

The only reason I was not diagnosed as severely depressed is because I was not having suicidal thoughts. Taking the time off turned out to be essential for me. It made me realize I could not fix my depression on my own. My thought process at the time was that if I was intelligent I'd find a solution to fix my depression, and the fact that I couldn't find a solution meant I was stupid, and not capable of doing my job. With help, I slowly began to realize that the problem was that my brain was not functioning the way it should. My brain alone couldn't realize it was not functioning correctly, and this is BECAUSE it wasn't functioning correctly. So I needed help, and started to take anti-depressants and do cognitive behavioral therapy. I'm in a much better place now.\n\nMy advice would be to talk to your manager about it as soon as you can. I know that will feel difficult for you right now. Maybe your sibling can help you draft an email to them? If you don't feel like you can talk to your manager, contact your HR representative. If your employer has an Employee Assistance Program, reach out to them, too. They will provide access to treatment and cover at least some of the cost.\n\nIt's great that you're getting support from family, that's invaluable.

Exams are a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nSeek help from friends, family, and professional health providers. Mental health is like a TVM equation; the more PV debt you have, the worse the FV and PMTs will be.\n\nImproving takes time. As an actuarial student, set expectations and create a budget. Analyze your actual performance against your expectations and adjust accordingly. If exams are significantly impacting you, consider pausing to avoid burnout, which can worsen your TVM equation.\n\nIf your manager is not understanding, pretend to be studying and taking exams. Make the process long and drawn out. You should also have access to Family Medical Leave of Absence for personal use, but it should be used as a last resort. Another possibility is being demoted to a non-actuarial analyst without exam support. In this situation, why does it matter losing exam support? Being laid off is unlikely, but being kicked out of the student program is very likely. If you don’t want to take exams, it shouldn’t matter. When you’re ready, be confident enough to self-fund your exam progress. \n\nConsider talking to your provider about increasing your medication strength, learning coping strategies, or trying cognitive behavioral therapy. Your anxieties are valid, and you must ensure you have health insurance to access professional help.', 'Meds and therapy are good. The only other thing that has helped me was cardio; I jog for at least 15 minutes everyday.\n\nAlso maybe your job is too stressful for you?', 'Thank you.

Living is so hard right now and I wish I could be normal again. I’ll try to take the exam process slower.', 'Not trying to trivialize your feelings into “just work out” but I want to second this. It is crazy what diet and exercise will do for some people who have walked through mental health struggles - it is actually what made mine manageable. Obviously do not stop the meds and therapy if they are helping you but exercise can be a great supplement to those things. I am also wondering if you have burnout. How stressful is your job? Do you have a lot of PTO available to take a vacation with your sibling who seems very happy to help you out with this? I am sure management would find a way for you to pause exams if it meant you could perform your job duties.

Then again, such a move would lead to a global reinsurance meltdown and we had a good 1st quarter so I feel like I'm okay for the next few months or so."", ""It's the same as it's been my entire life.

My current employer isn’t doing layoffs. Budgets for some clients are tightening, but there's still plenty of work to do and *more* work for several others due to regulatory changes.\n\nThese are scary times and a lot of people will sadly be affected, but actuaries tend to be more insulated. The partners have talked before about seeing all the other white collar workers on the streets downtown with boxes after being laid off in 2008/2009, while they just got to go home."", 'It depends on the fields. Health and Life may not be good at the moment. P&C is still doing fine. Reinsurance is doing well.', 'Structurally, the US continues to have a bifurcated economy, where people in the bottom 60% or so face a continual huge struggle to stay afloat and people in the upper echelons have manifold opportunities to pursue advancement, wealth-building, etc if they are saavy and flexible enough to adapt to changing landscapes and opportunities. Perceptions of the economy being strong or not often come down to which side of this bifurcation you inhabit.\n\nLong term, I think we are facing the same problems we’ve been staring down for a couple decades at this point: growing debt/GDP, the risk of national insolvency (and the negative consequences of the “cures” we will have to resort to), and a population that is growing older and sicker over time. Those definitely have the potential to make us permanently poorer and weaker as a nation. Mass deportations of young working-age people is only going to harm the worker/retiree ratio and resulting strain on the productive part of the population.\n\nShort term, there’s two main things I’m keeping an eye on right now: tariffs and (potential) massive Medicaid cuts. The tariffs I’m less concerned about, as the current administration has so little spine that they constantly roll back much of the tariffs as soon as they get any pushback. However, this has also instilled a lot of worrying complacency in the population, as an actual sustained trade war would be *devastating* to the economy and people seem to not realize this due to the economy not immediately crashing after one month of somewhat implemented tariffs. As a healthcare actuary, the looming huge Medicaid cuts have me very worried; not for the insurers themselves, but for what it will do to many provider systems and local economies.\n\nPersonally, my economic prospects are great. I’ve had a lot of wage growth the past few years, am in line for a promotion in 1-2 years that will be a significant boost, bought a house last fall with my fiancée in an affordable area for a very reasonable price (thanks, remote work!) and my company itself is actually doing very well (I don’t work for a health insurance company; their financials have been a struggle the past few years.)', ""To put it lightly, not too great.

Hopefully this is not the case, but even if it isn't, I still expect salaries to not rise with inflation, the price of real estate to continue expanding, and ever increasing national turmoil that (even if ignored for now) will eventually show up at my doorstep. Even if we as actuaries are largely safe due to high job security, high pay, and good benefits, I find it quite ignorant to believe that we don't need to worry about fixing these issues because our small subsection of society is largely unaffected by them. The people are becoming poorer and poorer, and every 'fix' that has been proposed only has driven us further into a pit of debt. Broke people have struggles paying their monthly premiums, so these problems will affect us eventually. Generation Alpha is, from what I've heard from teachers and from interactions I've had with them, largely distrustful of the system and disobedient (which every generation says, but one look at F students are inventors TikToks will let you know quickly how this situation is slightly different). This is for good reason, as these kids are essentially being told from the get-go how horrible their situation will become, and have been forced to watch the struggles of their parents that they know they will have to endure.

G&H students,

If you’re deep in the FSA grind, good news: the **SOA streamlined the path**, and it’s less chaotic than it used to be. It's still a heavy lift, but now it's more focused! 🙌

At PAK, we have outlines, flashcards, and custom-created practice questions to help you on your journey. 

A couple highlights:

* It is strongly recommended to take the G&H exams in order (i.e., 101- 201 - 301) as the later exams build on information in the earlier exams.
* GH101 (as compared with GHDP) has a significant amount of material removed, with some material retained and a few added items. GH101 should be available within the next week or two. All study manuals, flashcards, practice problems will be updated as quickly as possible.
* GH201-U (as compared with GHVR-U) has several readings added as either new readings or coming from other exams, as well as a sizeable chunk that was removed. GH201 should be ready by mid- to end-June.
* GH301 (as compared with GHRM) has the most changes, with a number of new readings and minimal material removed. GH301 will be the last to be updated, and should be available by the end of July.

As always, feel free to reach out to see how PAK may be beneficial on your journey to FSA!

ASTAM or PA?|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ksu213/astam_or_pa/|beers_express|1747928842.0|7|1ksu213|0.81|"I’ve taken a very long, drawn-out path towards ASA. I’m left with these two exams, and trying to decide the order to finish them. Some quick background; my last exam passed was FAM in July 2024. I’d be lying if I said the short term material was still fresh in my head. I have credit for exam SRM from a VEE class years ago before the transition, so that material is not fresh either. I also have credit for ATPA from exam MFE years ago. So ultimately looking for recommendations of which exam might be “easier” to work on next?

Thanks"|"['Honestly even if Fam-S isnt that fresh in your mind i would still recommend going for ASTAM. You can get familiar with the basics pretty quickly again. And then finishing the “Harder” Exam first is always a goal for me as i usually dread keeping hard things to the end.', ""I haven't checked the SOA site, but isn't PA quite a bit more expensive than ASTAM? If so, and if you **don't** have a company to pay for PA, I'd say ASTAM. If you do have company funding, then (like the other commenter) I'd go for the harder exam, ASTAM.\n\nSo I guess ASTAM?\n\n(I'm assuming it's harder than PA. I've passed all ASA exams (including IFM) except I haven't sat PA yet. ASTAM was absolutely the hardest, by quite a wide margin. Hoping to sit PA in October.)"", 'My company will pay for the exam, so the cost isn’t an issue. Typically I am also in favor of tackling the harder tasks first, but in this case I’ve considered going “easier” first to increase my chances of successful completion and showing that progress is being made. Both exams are October, so wasn’t sure which exam had the least material to get through.', 'Do ASTAM first while the math from the prelims is still fresh.', 'Personally, I found PA was the easiest exam of the entire track and I took it when it was 5 hours long. It’s really about communicating results more than anything else and I definitely found it was a lot easier to me than my colleagues who were earlier in their career. It sounds like you’re probably at a stage in your career where that would be easier for you as well. ASTAM is rough and while you may not have short term from FAM fresh in your mind, the way I would describe them in comparison is that FAM covers a wide breadth of material, but is pretty shallow in depth of knowledge required, while ASTAM takes some of those topics and goes really deep on what you need to know. Similar to you, I took a drawn out path. Personally, I took a 5 year break. When I was going to go back, a lot of people advised me to take PA to get my feet wet because they were hearing it was the easiest exam. At the time, I had not taken FAM yet, but I think PA was a good call.', ""I'd suggest tackling PA since it's the easier of the two you have left. You'll get any pass bonus or salary increase sooner, and it'll give you momentum going into your last exam. I took PA before SRM (with no SRM background), and I didn't find it too difficult."", 'You had plenty of good responses, but I have a very relatable experience so I wanted to chime in.\n\nYour company pays for both, both will get you raises. Go for the easier one first, which is PA. I just sat for PA and it is by far the easiest exam. So easy that you could even double up on modules(even the FSA modules) and be able to pass by October.\n\nI had a 100% pass rate on exams until I took STAM. I failed it twice, and had burnout resulting in taking time off until going back to ASTAM and passing it on the first try. I wasted almost 2 years on that exam track before finally passing.\n\nSTAM/ASTAM is by far the hardest exam out there. If you end up failing it really sets you back, assuming you are stuck on that exam track for work like I was.']"

Pay is good, WLB is good (for me, I don\'t mind some long weeks as long as I am given a lot of flexibility in how I meet those hours).  \n\nThe hardest part is, where I work anyway, is a bit of a wild wild west. In other words, you get some standard work, but if you want to get onto ""cooler"" projects, it is up to you to network. You get a lot of ownership over your career, but the downside is, no one is really looking out for your career. I have worked with some great actuaries who just can\'t network well (read: refuse to network) and so they end up leaving for different pastures. This is unfortunate, but I like the ownership. \n\n  \nOne more thing to mention, I am heavily encouraged to use my study time from my immediate supervisors. The firm doesn\'t have a great study program, and doesn\'t encourage us to study from a firm perspective, but from my actual supervisors, I am actively encouraged to focus on exams. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions!', ""My wife worked for one from associate to manager. She was in assurance, so I guess I can't say exactly what actuarial work would be like, but I got a good look into the culture there so I can say some things.\n\nPromotions seemed fairly structured but did require networking to get them. But I would say as long as you didn't isolate yourself you would have peers talking about their pathways quite regularly which, as long as you were regularly bringing the topic up with your coach, partners, and getting the feedback from your peers you'd be okay, assuming you have tolerance for the consulting workload and lifestyle. In this sense it was interesting to me to see how everyone there seemed to know what to do and what to say to get a promotion. This was a big contrast from my first company where I said nothing, none of my peers talked about promotions, and I was just all of a sudden promoted after 2 years - so watching her and her peers navigate their company was a valuable learning experience for me, looking from the outside.\n\nRaises were pretty good. I don't think there was a year that went by where she didn't get at least a 10% raise on a regular year and over 20% on a promotion year. Travel started getting busy once she was at the manager level, being away for a whole week several times per year, a situation that would only get busier the higher up she got. Eventually she wanted better work life balance and left.\n\nOne thing those companies are good at, or at least try to be good at, is getting their employees to think that they are the best place ever and they will try weird tactics to get you to stay (besides the above average annual raises) like guilt-tripping you into not quitting during busy season and telling you that your career would be over if you left consulting because no other opportunity would be as good. That kind of thing is mostly BS, try not to fall for it. You can read all about that in r/accounting. \n\nOverall I would say it's good experience to get your career started and has some good exit opportunities, but I don't think it's something you should yearn for or feel bad about if you decide on a different path.

In terms of the work you do? Curious why youd think one is more cut throat ?', 'This\xa0', ""Only looking at the major mutuals / insurers\n\nShareholder expectations complicate things a lot. Most mutuals will have to stay within their realistic expectations when it comes to product design, pricing etc. to protect their ratings, dividend payouts and policyholder expectations\n\nHowever, this complicates things especially with the hot market in annuities\n\n Mutuals can obviously compete but not to the level of something like Athene which has PE backing and can go much harder on reinsurance since they're not capped at 20% for a high AA or above rating. Public insurers can also provide much better caps for FIA, RILA etc. \n\nThe work wont differ much other than having more exposure to IFRS and GAAP on the non mutual insurer. However the intensity of work will increase due to the dual mandate (policyholders and shareholder expectations). This usually means that non mutuals move faster into new markets and are usually quicker on trends. Mutuals take time but when they do move its usually to carve out a piece of the market foe themselves and sit in it long term\n\nThis will probably not hold for smaller insurers because everyone tries to find an edge but its just been my observation working with major insurers.\n\nTheres also other things like ALM / iM and investment strategy, risk tolerance, RBC ratios but that's just due to different objectives/ mandates of mutual / non-mutuals""]"

Recently moved to the New York area and applied to a few jobs. Ended up getting an offer at a big firm, for about 50k more than I currently make. I’d be switching to a more hybrid financial/service consulting position, whereas I am currently fully financial. My current firm actually countered to slightly more than the new firms offer. I was happy to stay with my firm because it’s a fairly easy job and allows plenty of study time (also fully remote). However, the new firm came back with a counter-counter offer that’s about a 20k jump from their original offer. I think there is some major future upside to the new job financially, a much higher ceiling and uses the social skills I’ve worked hard to build. But it’s hybrid with a decent city commute, and I imagine it’ll be much more intense. I’m hesitant to leave my current firm as I’ve built a strong reputation for my work, and it truly is an easy job. Is the (potentially way) higher ceiling at a larger firm with potential for good connections worth the move? Just curious others thoughts!|"['for me 20k isnt ""remotely"" close to enough to give up fully remote. there is also the risk of the unknown vs the known at your current company which you seem to allude to.\n\nultimately no one can decide for you, but if you like your current employer, co-workers and work, especially the work life balance, I would have a hard time making the leap', 'I’d be questioning why your current employer was paying you 50k less prior to this, when they could have easily been doing so.', 'Is either company hiring?

I could say if he wasnt a man maybe he wouldnt be reprimanded and be equivalent to what you said then right? Because sure maybe but also you arent just reprimanded for being a man. So, you either did imply it or said something meaningless just to call him an asshole (which fine by me); Im not a logician, but I think thats what I\'d be safe concluding right?\n\nIn any case to the point many CAS members were mad just moves the question from ""how much of an asshole to get reprimanded"" to ""how many people do you have to piss off to get reprimanded under precept 1""?  My curiosity is still there to know the line haha.\n\nI wholly disagree with you on the impact of reprimand. It has impact.

If he isnt misrepresenting the situation, he was put on blast with no evidence suppprting any complaints and shows there seems to be a political lean in the ABCD and maybe specifically revenge against him directly. Revenge is not a good look for a disciplinary committee.', 'Thats reasonably put. Not sure where I draw the line on looks bad, but saying that specific dumb thing is worth a talking to or desist letter or something.\n\n But if I said the CAS is inept and is focused on growth over quality, that might come off making actuaries look bad in the same way but I would be pissed if the reprimanded me for it.', 'Did he provide the evidence of everything he said and everything other parties said?

Summary of syllabus changes for key Fall 2025 exams|54|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ks3qlr/summary_of_syllabus_changes_for_key_fall_2025/|jesmithiv|1747848556.0|36|1ks3qlr|1.0|"Here's a [detailed summary](https://www.theinfiniteactuary.com/files/TIA_Summary_of_Fall_2025_Changes.pdf) that we (TIA) put together of how key exams changed. 

TLDR of that 27-page document:

* Most sequenced courses (101/201 courses) are reduced versions of their predecessor. Notable exception: ILA-101 is a little larger than LPM. Most ""new"" material on 101/201 syllabi are readings transferred from pre-Fall 2025 exams.
* CP courses are more of a mixed bag and have a broader mix of transferred vs. brand new content, but in general, CP courses contain more entirely new content than the sequenced courses and bear less resemblance to their previous counterpart, if any. Notably, CP-351 retained only 2 readings from LAM, or 3% of the syllabus by page count (but imported a number of readings from the discontinued IRM exam and others)
* The majority of our courses will be substantially complete before the end of June, and will have plenty of content to start with very soon.

Thanks for your patience as we get things in place!

These models basically show how much per member per month will increase or decrease. To be more specific, I am given budget to hire consultants from iqvia and others to make the BIM.

I am curious to know whether insurance companies are ever using the BIM provided by a pharma company or ever find it useful. I hear not so much. 

Any insights or pointing me to a report outlining how insurance company handles the impact of new drugs on premiums will be much appreciated! "|[]

Patrol officers are well-paid (location dependent) because it's dangerous work.\n\nActuaries are well-paid because the exam process is grueling and the subject matter is kinda dull and uninspiring. Not many people are passionate about annuity tables or whatever. To me, that's a pretty OK deal. Just spend a few years grinding out ASA. Spend a few more grinding out FSA if you're kinky like that.

The advantages for actuaries, relative to doctors, are highest if you want to retire early and lowest if you want to retire late, since actuaries get a huge “head start” over doctors and doctors only “catch up” later in life.\n\nAs for whether that counts as rich, that really depends on perspective.

Actuaries probably have a tendency to be fiscally aware and risk averse by profession. Which would translate to more long term investing in the market. I saw some statistics that only 60% of doctors over 65 had a net worth of 250k, which is interesting because many of them likely earn over 250k in yearly salary. I think that points to a spending habit across the profession. Those figures could be slightly off but they’re around that ball park, this leads me to believe doctors have a much lower tendency to invest and save compared to actuaries. But I’m basing that assumption on my own habits. I’d be interested to see a similar over 65 study for actuaries. \n\nWhat leads to wealth is often successful long term investments. Over the last 30 years since 1993 the market has increased 17 times, obviously if you had been gradually investing since then you’d be pretty well off right now.

But, at the end of the day, if you going to try to model risk, you’d want it modelled by those who you trust (in ability and ethics). Now, im not saying all actuaries are the smartest or most ethical people, but I think the qualification process does a decent job of getting rid of some of the bad apples. It’s by no means perfect, but it serves a purpose.\n\nNow, on significance & relevance: whether you like it or not, truth is, humans derive a significant amount of utility (In their daily living) from ‘certainty’ about the future, or at least some level of it. And actuaries are needed to provide that service at a price point that has the biggest net positive impact on society (i.e. cheap enough for consumer, but still protecting the provider of the funding / investor). So I’d say that’s pretty significant & relevant.\n\nIs it as important as being a doctor or teacher? Personally, I’d say no. But I’d still say it’s pretty important in general, and offers a better work-life-balance.\n\nAs with all products/services, job are paid in line with supply & demand. And as you mentioned before, there are very few actuaries in the world (particularly owing to the gruelling qualification process). And that’s why they are paid relatively well.\n\nI’m sure many enter the career with this prospect in mind- getting paid well, while adding value to society in a way that best suits their skillset (strong analytical ability & communication). Add the good work-life-balance, and it suddenly appeals to someone who might be family-oriented and wants to provide a sense of support/stability to their community.\n\nEveryone has different reasons for entering the profession, but the career most certainly is important for society. And a very small proportion of actuaries are as unhappy/dull/unethical as you initially made them out to be.  \n\nBut I’m sure your view stems from personal experience of a few bad apples (as it is very emotionally charged), so can completely understand why you might be painting the profession with the same brush. I know some power-hungry, entitled doctors who proudly boast about overcharging patients and medical schemes. As well as some sketchy teachers. But i won’t paint them all with the same brush though.\n\nI’d say, if OP has an aptitude for maths and the actuarial world excites them (as a whole i.e. the work, the WLB & pay, as well as the qualification process), then by all means they should follow the path.\n\nOP wanted to know the extent to which actuaries are ‘well compensated’. To answer that question, I’d say again: google ‘careercast actuary ranking’ for your answer. Because imo the job satisfaction is the best measure of ‘pay’. A job that pays well in monetary terms but also allows great WLB. A path that provides you a skillset that is very transferable. Hence, the high job satisfaction.   \n\nSo, OP, actuaries are very very well compensated holistically', 'So your a quant then?', 'My friend this is beyond bitter.

Pricing models VS Capital Models|2|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kqcu60/pricing_models_vs_capital_models/|Dry_Weird8391|1747664267.0|7|1kqcu60|0.75|"I would like to know if a capital model can be used as a pricing model or vice versa. 

  
It's my understanding that capital model is figuring out how much money the company needs to hold in order to write certain volumes of business and that pricing models figure out the amount of premium to charge. Therefore, couldn't you just use a capital model and then add in some profit margins/loads to make it into a pricing model? 

I guess I'm just curious for the key differences between them. Like what things would be in a pricing model that's not in a capital model? 

"|"[""A key difference is the source of where the money comes from. For premiums, the money comes from the policyholder, whereas for capital, the money comes from the company's owners and investors. I guess this distinction would be different for a mutual company but I've only ever worked for stock insurers so someone else can chime in there.\n\nPricing and capital models answer different questions about the business, and they are integrated as well. For pricing, it's how much do I charge this policyholder so that on average the premiums are sufficient? Capital serves a different purpose - it kicks in when premiums for a business segment are insufficient, acting as a safeguard for unforeseen catastrophes. So you can think of premium models as being analogous to your weekly personal budget balancing bills and income, and capital models on how to divide your personal wealth into a safety net, college fund, retirement fund, home down payment fund, etc. For a capital model, it's how much of the company's money goes towards supporting homeowners, aviation, general liability, etc.\n\nPricing models and capital models are also integrated in the sense that owners and investors contribute capital in expectation of some kind of return. So if a business segment is allocated $X in capital one question is, what is my return on capital? The pricing model must not only result in an adequate amount of premium to cover expected losses, it also must result in an acceptable return on capital, so pricing models often use capital model results in accept/reject decisions."", ""Depend on how your company defines each model. If your pricing model is just a group of cash flows in aggregate and your capital model is in a similar setup, then maybe yes. However, from my own experience, they are always very different and serve for different functionalities. A pricing model is normally only for a product or a block of business. It has product specific assumptions which are more granular. Capital model is usually aggregated. It's hard to adjust certain assumptions for a selected product only.\n\nI think your understanding of capital model and pricing model is very narrow. Probably talking to your manager/supervisor is the best route."", '🤔🤔🤔', ""It's common to leverage an existing model to create a different model for a different purpose. It may have different frameworks and methodology, but it is always a good starting point.\n\nI can't comment on your specific situation though since I don't know much about these two model."", ""I know it's used a lot in retro pricing and some reinsurance, particularly property cat. \n\nWhen you have very limited data, due to no claims activity in cat or several classes of business sliced in different ways it makes sense. Think a retro QS on a mixed QS/XoL book that is covering international specialty, how do you even begin?\n\nA robust capital model will rely on (potentially) fewer key assumptions, which allows you to price such complex deals."", 'This. Exactly what I was going to say.\n\nWe build a Capital model at high level with all products, do a lot of work to consider correlation between products to help minimize the capital required in total. We then use that information to divide total capital to the respective products.\n\nOur product level pricing models contain more granularity so we can distinguish between risk of loss and vary premium. Capital really only comes in to determine profit load needed to assure an adequate return on that capital.', ""Okay. Based on your comment, does that mean that since the pricing model is only for a specific type of business it would not have like a correlation matrix in it since it's more granular. Capital models have correlation matrix because we need to correlate between different lines of business as well as different types of risks?""]"

Even though seasonal AR models of a general order are very briefly introduced on page 282 of Frees, the illustrative example on the same page focuses on the order 1 case, so AR(1) models (the standard type or seasonal type) are AR models most likely to show up on the exam, if there are questions on AR models at all.\n\nHope this helps clear up any confusion.', 'In my view, the practice exams in Actex was good enough to pass SRM.

I’m about to start a GIS/planning role (just graduated), but I’ve recently been invited to interview for a position involving catastrophe modeling. I’m not sure if I’ll pursue it, but I have a meteorology background and have always been curious about the intersection of GIS and hazard modeling, so I’m exploring whether this is something I might want to grow into long-term.

If anyone here works in catastrophe modeling (or has in the past), I’d love to hear your perspective:
- What’s the day-to-day like?
- What platforms/tools do you use (RMS, AIR, HAZUS, etc.)?
- How does GIS fit into the workflow?
- Is it very coding-heavy or more geospatial/data focused?
- What kinds of orgs do this kind of work (insurance, gov, consulting?)
- Anything you wish you knew before starting?

I’m happy with my new job I think, just want to make an informed decision and learn more about future options. Thanks so much in advance!

I simply can’t put the time in because I just am not that interested in the subject matter, and it feels like a waste of time when I try and study. I have no motivation for passing these exams. I am considering talking to my boss about stopping taking exams all together. Would this be a bad decision for my career?

How many people do you think genuinely care about the material?  Saying you CAN\'T put time/effort into them is downright silly my dude. You simply don\'t WANT to study, and aren\'t being disciplined enough to do it.\n\n9 exam sittings in 24 months is less than 3 months per sitting on average. I think you should try taking more time to study between sittings, especially if you aren\'t passing for multiple sittings in a row. Taking them quickly is pointless when you\'re failing over two thirds of the sittings. Or maybe if you\'re stuck on one exam, switch to a different one to gain some traction.\n\nDon\'t do it for the material. Do it for the fat ass raises, and the work/life balance when you\'re done. Good luck OP.', 'With all due respect, I think the actuarial career just isn’t for you. To be certified, you need to be minimum ASA/ACAS which requires passing exams.

But if I did that I\'m sure I would\'ve burned out the same way you have because I had zero interest or motivation to work in this field.\n\nMy unhappiness in my current career (the one I wanted so badly, that a lot of people want, and that I\'m performing really well in), is my main driver to pass exams. I\'m enjoying studying because it aligns with the future I want for myself and my family. I don\'t truly regret going into this field because it was what I was called to do and it really felt like the stars aligned for me to be here (even though I\'ve grown to dislike it due to the lack of growth potential).\n\nLeaving your job is a big risk, but if it\'s not working, it\'s not working. It\'s possible you\'ll find a career you can be content with somewhere else. Or you may dislike it wherever you fo next, and find new motivation to go back to actuarial work and pass those exams.\n\nHonestly, listen to your gut. Go try a different career on for size. If you hate it, you can jump back in. It might look funny on your resume, but if you\'re qualified and sociable, which you probably are, employers care less than you might think.

And maybe think ""what would I do if I could do anything?"" Because you\'re young and it\'s the perfect time to try something outside the box. You have plenty of time to build your career even if you spend the next 5 years as a park ranger in Idaho and then come back LOL. You can\'t always force motivation and there is nothing wrong with LIVING while you\'re young and not tied down, and trying different things out. If you don\'t have kids or own a house, you are in a stage of life where you can really bounce around freely compared to where you might be down the line if those things are in your plan. So try it now.\n\nBut yeah, like everyone is saying, the exams are part of the whole deal. There\'s give and take with every career and that\'s the big ""give"" for this one.

As others have said, it's very hard to be an actuary without the exams. There are related roles, but won't necessarily be the same. So it's just really about what you want to do. \n\nIf you were on the P&C side, I could suggest a whole bunch of good options but I'm not quite as sure on SOA side. If it's the SOA material, you may try jumping to a P&C job, which might reinvigorate you with different material. I started SOA but switched after first few exams, best decision I ever made."", ""Short term you have a few options. 1 is see if your company has roles that are actuarial in nature but don't require exams. At my company, they throw business in the middle when you aren't taking exams so actuarial analyst 3 versus actuarial business analyst 3.  Most likely you'll be on teams with heavy data or heavy coding projects where actuarial skills are helpful, but you don't need to sign off on anything. Your second choice is to go  to a consulting firm where they prioritize working your butt off over exam progress. I have a buddy who's been an actuary 15ish years and has only passed 3 exams. He works his butt off so the company keeps him. With that said either of these paths will severely limit you in the career. And we're not talking just financially. As you get older it will be darn near impossible for you to leave your company. So a boss you really like leaves and you get a terrible boss. You want to leave, but every position you apply for would prefer a younger/cheaper actuary with your level of exams. Especially when you factor in now college courses count for exams. I hate most exams too and I just got my ASA after taking exams on and off for 14 years. So it can be done.

Something to think about.  If you choose to pivot away from exams a new career path entirely might give more growth porential.  ASA exams can seem irrelevant and boring- and some of it will remain irrelevant, but some fits in place later. \n\nIn response to some of the other comments.

I do not regret ignoring my exam process for years. I also found myself in better shape for exams in my mid age because I become more mature in handling stresses. I also worked for several companies so far. Almost all have quasi-actuarial roles that do not require exam writing, nowadays mostly called data science. I have seen those also moved to other companies. So, there must be market for those  non-designated actuaries.

I worked at two insurance companies—one of them being one of the largest in Hong Kong. I struggled to keep up with the workload. While I enjoyed using my skills in a professional setting, the stress was overwhelming, and I eventually quit. At that time, I had only passed Exam P. I kept failing—four times for P and four times for FM. I lost motivation and ended up giving up on the actuarial path to become a math teacher instead.\n\nTeaching was fun for the first couple of years, but eventually it started to feel repetitive. I found myself doing the same thing year after year, with no new challenges or discoveries in math. And yes, dealing with parents was also tough.\n\nAbout two years ago, I started rethinking my career. I had tried both of my dream paths—actuarial science and education—and realized that the main issue had been the stress of the exams and not seeking help when I needed it. So I decided to give it another shot. I started with FM again, and now I’ve passed FAM and am currently studying for PA. Unfortunately, actuarial job opportunities are limited in my town, so finding a position has been tough.\n\nIf you truly love this field, I encourage you to push through the exams.

Data analytics - this can be a wide array of things, some companies want you to have additional degrees, but generally entry level is knowing how to pull/manipulate data, which most p&c actuaries know how to do. So, if you enjoy working with the data, creating reports, powerbi, tableau, or whatever other software. \n2. Data science - again some companies might want extra degrees but more for those that enjoy the modeling aspect, python, R, or softwares. Generally doing more than just pricing models. Our data science team does fraud models, claims modeling, etc, work a lot with the actuaries but aren't actuaries.\n3. Cat modeling - another data manipulation job, some companies employ people solely to manipulate data and run through cat model so know Hurricane, earthquake, wildfire risk of large properties looking to insure. Also generally do portfolio modeling for companies whole portfolio. This is a good way to get in at Reinsurers too. This path can also have a higher trajectory, as gain knowledge can spread to other types of modeling or at least be seen due to managing a companies catastrophe risk.\n4. Underwriting - now getting a CPCU is more exams, but if more outgoing and more into that aspect of insurance, I've seen many switch over. This is also a high trajectory path, I've found actuaries that switched to this understand the overall picture better from their background, so easier to move into management and if ambitious enough can go much higher.\n5. Product / regulatory- you maybe aren't as good with people but really enjoy policy language / regulation. You generally work with the actuaries in designing products, usually responsible for filings and/or compliance. Kinda more like a researcher, as these folks are always the one's that inform me when there is something new I might need to do in my pricing.\n6. IT/project manager - in P&C there is a big need for people that are organized and can translate things from product/pricing/business into IT. Generally writing requirements, verifying with business it meets their request then getting IT to get it done. \n7. UAT - user acceptance testing - this is the other end from #6, just verifying what was programmed works. Requires good documentation skills and being meticulous. \n\n6 and 7 aren't the most glamorous but it's generally jobs that translate well across a lot of fields and thus easy to find once in that path. Trajectory isn't overly high though unless you want to go deeper into IT and can move yourself towards a CTO/CIO position. My group gets involved in UAT a lot to verify the rating works the way we intended. I have a guy who stopped at 5 exams that does this work for me. Your upside is really limited if your company lets you stay in the actuarial department but you don't obtain credentials. You can do a lot of tasks but will get passed over for manager roles and not much room for promotion. That kinda limits your salary potential, so although you may seem fine now and can do the work, if you want to move up, you have to take a leap and start over in an aspect you enjoy so you can push yourself up to expert at something and add value to the company thus get promotions.

So it isn’t worth it spending all those years and effort on way more difficult pathways to become an actuary. \n\nI would say it is relatively easy in the Netherlands to find a job if you complete an actuarial masters degree.

Automated AI Grading for FSA Exams|0|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kpbz57/automated_ai_grading_for_fsa_exams/|The_Actuarial_Nexus|1747543717.0|9|1kpbz57|0.25|"Hello, I am curious how much interest there is in using AI grading software to study for FSA exams.

The system effectively takes your written response, grades it, and gives you feedback when working through past exam questions. There are several other helpful features, which were listed in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ieshyn/free\_exam\_pa\_study\_tool/](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ieshyn/free_exam_pa_study_tool/)

The software itself has already been tested for Exam PA, so all of the reported bugs have been fixed. There were 150+ distinct users averaging 100+ subtasks each, which I believe indicates some level of effectiveness/value given the repeat usage. Expanding it to FSA exams basically just requires uploading the exam questions to the platform.  
  
**How interested would you be in using something like this for Fall 2025?** Basic services would be free, but rate limited. Full unlimited access will be paid (exact cost TBD, but something reasonable).

**Does your company reimburse for supplemental study material?** This is purely a grading system. There are no manuals or videos. Custom exams might be added in the future, after Fall 2025.  
  
**If you’re interested, which FSA exam do you plan to take next?** Exams may be prioritized based on comments upvotes. The course list can be found here: [https://fsa2025.soa.org/flexible-pathway/](https://fsa2025.soa.org/flexible-pathway/)  
"|"['I’m personally not very interested, the reason being it feels like too much spoon-feeding. Part of effective studying is digging through the materials to find the nuances I missed when answering the past questions. If I get a question wrong and an AI just gives me what I missed, that doesn’t give me the opportunity to reread that section of the material and, (1) not just find what I missed, but (2) expose me to other relevant information that was not part of the question but is still very helpful for the exam. There’s a lot of critical thinking skills that need to be honed for the FSA topics, and it’s hard to make those mental connections without just taking time to look at all the material and digesting it myself. \n\nI might consider using an AI tool if I was really struggling with a specific topic and just needed something explained or reworded better. But at that point, do I need an actuarial specific AI? Or would the free Chat GPT suffice? Or could I just go to my manager or a coworker?', ""Theoretically interested but my trust in AI is far too low. More importantly, the people grading my actual exams will be humans, and not the AI, and I don't want to accidently train myself to answer in a way the AI wants but not the graders."", 'Considering we are going to have brand new FSA exams, I would not trust any study material for the first sitting tbh. And AI has such a bad track record with actuarial questions in general, I wouldn’t trust it', 'Am very interested', 'Thanks for sharing your perspective.\n\n**""If I get a question wrong and an AI just gives me what I missed, that doesn’t give me the opportunity to reread that section of the material...""**  \nMy initial thinking was that having AI tell a candidate what they missed would be an efficiency improvement, since it frees up time to actually focus on studying rather than identifying parts of your solution that match with the answer key. It\'s interesting to hear that this would detract from the study process. Do you find value in peer grading or instructor feedback, and would you view AI grading as significantly different from those?\n\n**""But at that point, do I need an actuarial specific AI? Or would the free Chat GPT suffice?""**  \nTechnically, you *could* copy and paste the relevant parts from the past exam PDFs into ChatGPT, add a relevant prompt, and potentially achieve similar results, but I\'m not sure this is an effective use of study time. It\'s quite cumbersome to find all the relevant parts in the PDF, convert them to a readable format, and paste them into ChatGPT, especially over and over again.  \n  \nThere are also several analytics and non-AI features built into the system that add value beyond what ChatGPT can offer (link in original post). Because AI automatically ***quantifies*** candidate responses, it opens the door for numerical analysis on study performance (e.g. accuracy rate, average mock exam score, user levels, etc.). This can then be used to gauge performance vs other candidates (i.e. pass rate), or absolute preparedness (i.e. pass mark).\n\n**""Or could I just go to my manager or a coworker?""**  \nYes, you could. I guess everyone is different. I would turn to AI first if it were frictionless (which is the end goal here), then only ask a human if I suspect AI is making stuff up or can\'t give me a good answer.', ""That's a great point, although I imagine an AI can be prompted to emulate a human grader with the right instructions (this may take some tinkering to get right)."", 'Great!', ""> it frees up time to actually focus on studying rather than identifying parts of your solution that match with the answer key.\n\nI consider the process of comparing my response to the solution to be studying. There's value in looking at what I thought was the right answer and thinking through how I get from there to what the SOA is expecting. Did I miss some important points in a list? Did I misinterpret the question entirely? Did I just misread something? \n\n> Do you find value in peer grading or instructor feedback, and would you view AI grading as significantly different from those?\n\nI think the other commenter had the best take on this. It's going to be an actual human grading my real paper, so using an AI for feedback on practice problems may be shooting myself in the foot. \n\n> it opens the door for numerical analysis on study performance\n\nThis sounds like Coaching Actuaries with more steps. And I don't know how realistic that is for FSA exams, where the questions can be a combination of quantitative and qualitative, and grading can be so subjective. One grader may consider someone's response deserving of full credit, while another grader could say they only get half credit - it's not like the prelims where a multiple choice question is either right or wrong. I don't think an AI can appropriately give feedback in a situation like that (especially since even the SOA's own solutions can have errors and vary in quality - how can one appropriately train an AI on such messy data?)\n\n> only ask a human if I suspect AI is making stuff up or can't give me a good answer.\n\nI don't think it's safe to assume that someone studying for an FSA exam will always be able to snuff out AI nonsense. The material on these exams is often new to candidates, so their BS meter is going to be poorly calibrated just due to the sheer amount of material on the exam. If I go to a human first, I have a lot more confidence they'll just help me the right way the first time. And, on top of helping me with the exam material, they may give me some real-world info that can help the information further stick in my head. I'm not confident that an AI will be able to reliably provide that kind of info."", ""These are definitely some valid pain points I will need to consider and work through. I'm not entirely convinced these are unsurmountable hurdles for AI, especially in the long term.\n\nVery valuable feedback; thanks again!""]"

FAP Final Assessment — Timing Confusion & Best Approach?|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kodng6/fap_final_assessment_timing_confusion_best/|RookieHoyt|1747434338.0|1|1kodng6|0.81|"Hey all,

I just wrapped up the last FAP module (finally) and can now register for the FAP Final Assessment. When I went to the SOA site, I noticed there are multiple “versions” with different timeframes. Seems like they run these 3-4 times a year.

When I register, do I get slotted into a specific window based on when I register? Or can I pick when to download and start the FA?

For example:

* There’s a version open now that ends on May 30, 2025.
* The next one starts June 2, 2025, but results wouldn’t come out until mid-November.

That wait feels long. But since the current window ends in 2 weeks, is it too tight to aim for that one? (I know it’s a 96-hour timed assessment once downloaded.)

Also, I'm probably paying for this myself unless my company reimburses me, so I want to be smart about it.

Any advice from folks who’ve gone through this? Would love to hear how you approached it.

Thanks!"|"[""Once you register, you'll then be able to take it when you want after that, you aren't locked in to taking it in the current window just because that's when you registered.\n\nJust note, if you want to take it in the current window, you have 96 hours or until the current window closes, whichever is earlier...so if you start may 29th, you won't get the full 96 hours.\n\nIf you have the time and feel ready, I'd suggest going for it in this window, you'll be waiting a while if you push it into the next one.""]"

I would never have stumbled across this if it hadn't been for you guys steering me in the right direction, so thank you! Here's a link to the website: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa

ORIGINAL POST:
My ex and I were married for over 25 years. In our divorce, I was awarded 50% of the portion of his pension accrued during the years of our marriage (approx. 22 years). He paid in a few additional years after our divorce before retiring. I have NOT started receiving payments on my portion yet. We do have a QDRO. 

He retired early due to a disability and began drawing his pension early. I was not notified when he commenced, but found out a few years later when I contacted the pension department about my plan. My ex is now over the age of 62, which is the minimum age at which one can commence payments without early withdrawal penalties. I only recently learned that they assessed the penalty against him when he began withdrawals.

I recently received the financial breakdown of my account payments. It clearly shows an early withdrawal penalty also assessed on my portion, even though I waited until my ex turned 62, as I was advised to do. I called to confirm that the penalty is correct, yet the CS agent is adamant that I am NOT being assessed a penalty. But I literally have a document from the actuary department that indicates otherwise.

So is this a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing? Or am I being lied to? Does it sound accurate that the penalty would be assessed to both of us, although I personally met the filing requirements? The pension administrator resisted providing the actual financial breakdown to me for several years; I had to involve an attorney to finally get it, so there is a history of conflict there. The commencement packet never has the full breakdown, only the amount that I would receive monthly. For this reason, I wonder if they're trying to be deceptive.

I don't know who to turn to to have this independently evaluated. It seems to be out of the purview of my divorce attorney. Please help!"|"['Your attorney should know an attorney who can help if he can’t.

If you are younger than he is then the benefit is typically less than the benefit you would receive if you are the same age.

Be clear. You provided a statement showing a penalty, but you’re telling me there’s no penalty. I need to understand how to reconcile those two statements, I need to know the correct values. Somewhere in there, make it clear that your next step is to contact the state insurance commissioner. That phrase should get supervisors involved and prompt them to get their shit together behind the scenes to get you the right answer. \nIf that doesn’t work, then do contact the state insurance commissioner (google “[your state] department of insurance”, look for info on how to file a complaint). They will contact the company directly, and these complaints are taken very seriously at senior levels within the company.', 'Can you provide more detail on the ""withdrawal penalty?"" Without all of the information, I\'m reading this as the penalty could be an early retirement factor, and if the reduction is from age 62 - and given his longer years of service and most plans having a normal retirement age of 65 - then he is subject to an early retirement subsidy given his long service.\n\nLots of big ifs thrown in there, but it\'s one way I could see this making some sense. If there was an early retirement subsidy, then check if the QDRO mentions whether you are entitled to subsidies that  your ex is entitled to. It may need to be explicitly stated if the QDRO is assigning a portion of the accrued benefit to you rather than a portion of the benefit being paid. With all of this said, I am not a lawyer and none of this is legal advice.', 'Hope you get some clarification soon! I can imagine it’s very frustrating playing phone tag.\n\nI’m not a pension actuary (only did a couple internships way back), but do you have confirmation that his employer/pension plan administrator had the details of your settlement?\xa0', 'One rule that applies to all QDROs is that the QDRO cannot increase the total value of the benefit. This means that the alternate payee (you) cannot receive any special benefits (like an unreduced early retirement) if the participant (your ex) does not get that special benefit.\n\nBased on what you’ve said, I suspect that this plan has a normal retirement age of 65, and offers early unreduced retirement at age 62 (presumably with a service requirement). Since your ex retired before age 62, he did not qualify for that unreduced benefit (and you mentioned disability, but he may not have met the plan’s requirements for a disability benefit), so you can’t get it either.\n\nOf course it’s still possible that someone at the administrator made an error in either the facts of your situation or the calculation, it is worth looking into.\n\nOne issue that might be causing some confusion is in the terminology. In the pension world, we don’t refer to a reduction for early retirement as a “penalty” because the *value* of the benefit is typically the same or better. That is, a plan might reduce your benefit by 3% for each year before age 65 that you start it. But for someone with average life expectancy, a benefit of $910 / month starting at age 62 is more valuable than waiting 3 years and then starting a benefit of $1,000 / month at 65.', 'I am a pension actuary and it sounds like you have got someone looking into this, but I just wanted to comment that without the QDRO and a plan document, it is impossible to answer your questions.\n\n\nWhen the QDRO was put in place, they should have created a record in the plan just for you with your portion of the accrued benefit. His commencement should have been completely independent of your benefit.', '[removed]', ""Thank you! I'll definitely ask for a referral."", ""Thank you for this info! I'll definitely follow up!"", ""The Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is the normal way to split benefits after something like a divorce. There are a bunch of ways to structure a QDRO. One common way is to split the Defined Benefit at the Normal Retirement Date (this sounds like a DB plan because I've never seen a Cash Balance plan that wouldn't give a lump sum option in my 2 years of PRT, which would have simplified this whole comparison). Alternatively, the QDRO could specify that an x% J&S annuity be elected with the Ex listed as the beneficiary and have the payments split in some way. It's really up to the courts to figure something out. \n\nIf the QDRO was structured in a way that the penalty affected both sides, I would expect that both signatures would be required to elect to start the benefit.

He was basically forced to resign just a few months before he would\'ve met the conditions of the Rule of 85. However, his pension plan has a provision that states anyone commencing retirement at age 62 or older, with more than 10 years of vested service (which he had), will not be assessed an early withdrawal penalty. Outside of these exceptions, anyone choosing to commence withdrawals prior to age 65 is subject to an early withdrawal penalty of 4% per year from age 65. He began drawing his portion at age 57 (resulting in reduced payments), but I was advised by the pension administrator that I should wait until he turned 62 to apply for my portion to avoid this penalty. But it seems that I\'m being assessed the penalty anyway. They won\'t tell me why, whether they\'re just penalizing me the same way they\'re penalizing him (since he\'s the participant and I\'m the alternate payee), or if there\'s some other reason or condition that I have not met.\n\nUltimately, if they could justify reducing my payments with an actual reason, I\'m fine with that. I feel that I\'m within my rights to receive an explanation, but they won\'t disclose one. Instead, they\'re telling me that they are NOT reducing my payment in any way, but I have the literal document in my hand that says otherwise. It specifically lists my base payment, less the life expectancy adjustment (because I\'m younger than my ex), and then an ""early withdrawal penalty"". I feel like I\'m being gaslit. It makes no sense.', 'Also, his plan does specifically say that I AM entitled to any additional subsidies that may accrue during my eligibility dates.', 'Yes, I have several documents where they acknowledge receipt of the QDRO. But…the first time I called them, they had no idea that one existed, and they had already been paying benefits to my ex for two years. After several months and many phone calls, they found it, and although they would never admit to me that they were paying my ex the full pension instead of just his portion, he now gets about $2k less per month than he was originally receiving. Needless to say, my confidence in their abilities and integrity is shaken.', 'That makes sense. I\'m not sure why the terminology that they use is ""early withdrawal penalty"". But it follows what you said… Full benefit at age 65 and older, reduced benefit by 4% per year from age 65, unless the employee is 62 and has at least 10 years of vested service (which my ex has). Since he started drawing his portion before 62, I assume his payments are reduced accordingly, but I was specifically told that if I waited until he turned 62 to start my portion, it would be the full benefit. \n\nI finally got my hands on the calculation sheet, and it definitely indicates that my benefit is being reduced for two reasons: the life expectancy adjustment, and the early withdrawal penalty. However, when I speak to them on the phone, they continue to insist that my payments are NOT being reduced due to early withdrawal. So the paperwork they sent says one thing, but when I try to speak to someone on the phone, they tell me something different. I can live with the reduction if it\'s in accordance with the plan benefit, but I\'d like to have a consistent answer. At this point, I\'ve been told so many conflicting things that my trust in them is completely shot. \n\nThere are many things that I haven\'t even addressed here that they\'ve messed up. Over the past several years, I\'ve spoken to maybe 20 different customer service agents, and you\'d think it was the first day on the job for every single one of them. But you\'re not allowed to speak to anyone higher up.', 'I work in pensions, this is pretty typical in QDROs. Ex gets half of the benefit that was accrued during the marriage. So say he worked 20 years, accrued a benefit of $2,000. But he was married for 10 of those years and earned $1,000 of his benefit in those 10 years, his ex will get 50% of the $1,000 he earned while they were married, so $500. He gets the rest. If they were married the entire time he was accruing a benefit, then she will often up with 50% even.\n\nPresumably there is a balance somehow (maybe he gets some of her retirement or some other financial compensation), but we only see the one side of it.', ""Well, we were married for 25 years. I was a stay-at-home mom, raising four kids. We moved every couple of years, all over the country, for his job. When his midlife crisis hit, he dumped me and the kids, married a much younger mail-order bride from China, and now has two toddlers. He's in his 60s. He has no contact with our adult children. He's never met our grandchildren. You can't make this stuff up.\n\nBut to be perfectly clear, me taking the pension I'm entitled to is not punitive. It's the deal we made when we agreed that I would forgo my career and future income-earning potential to raise our family. If we'd made different choices as a couple, if I'd had my own career and earned my own pension, we wouldn't be having this discussion."", 'Not relevant to the topic or the actuarial field.', ""That's one of the questions I have. If a judge ordered that a portion of the pension belongs to me, it doesn't seem right that someone else can make decisions that affect my benefit, without my knowledge or consent.

But I'm really just hoping for clarification, plain answers, and a documented response that I can trust. (edited for grammar)"", 'I would recommend requesting a copy of the summary plan description.  Sometimes there are different rules for unreduced retirement based on when a person was last employed.  Most plans I know of have the normal retirement age of 65, so early retirement reductions are usually assesed from there.  Some plans have provisions for unreduced at 62 if certain benchmarks were met such as service, retirement from active status etc etc.  The QDRO(qualified domestic relations order) should also stipulate if you are entitled to share in any early retirement subsidies.  If you are not able to share in any early retirement subsidies then you may be reduced from normal retirement age.', 'While I was googling insurance commissioners, I ran across the Employee Benefits Security Administration, a division of the US Department of Labor.

He retired early in 2017 due to a disability, so I'm not sure if the timing or circumstances surrounding his departure is a factor. These are all great points to revisit, so thanks for responding!"", ""I definitely have the receipts! I've been told repeatedly by their own customer service agents that I should have my own account set up (and that they will personally follow up on that), but it never happens. In order for me to actually even get an agent on the phone, I have to first go through an automated system that requires me to input my ex's SS#, date of birth, and zip code (mine doesn't work). Then it automatically tells me how much his last direct deposit was. Of course, I've informed him of this because it's a gross violation of HIS privacy, but neither of us have been able to facilitate me getting an independent account set up. I'm still listed as an alternate payee on his account which is why I believe they're justifying assessing me the same early withdrawal penalty that they're charging him. We've been divorced for 14 years. They've had plenty of time to get this right."", 'Thank you!', ""Let's hope the law doesn't regress back to that. Nobody wants to see me fight back and end up in prison, or worse, burned at the stake, lol. 🔥🔥🔥"", 'Note that it might also depend how your QDRO was written in the section of benefit commencement. But regardless, i imsgine you should be having your own account. Hopefully this issue gets resolved by you informing them of your next steps cause I doubt is intentional, maybe incompetence or maybe a misunderstanding given that QDROs are sometimes tricky.

Best FSA Exam/Resource For Understanding Investments/Hedging on UL?|11|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1knt6nn/best_fsa_examresource_for_understanding/|Rakan_Fury|1747373182.0|3|1knt6nn|1.0|"Potentially very stupid question, but hoping this might make sense to someone with an answer.

I work in life pricing on a UL product, and part of my regular work involves monthly hedging and crediting rate setting for some of our funds. Setting par rates, calculating notional amounts, etc.

The problem is, while I can follow the documentation and understand the grunt level work of ""put value X into cell A4, then run macro Y"", I feel like I don't conceptually understand what's actually happening, and so far unfortunately attempts to get my manager to explain or self teach haven't been very fruitful. (For the record, I don't blame my manager here, he seems extremely knowledgeable on investments and has helped me to learn and understand so many other work aspects, but his explanations here just aren't getting through to me.)

Now while I can't say I particularly enjoy the FSA exams, I do find that so far on the ILA track, there has been a lot of relevant/applicable material to my work. I've passed LPM and just sat for LFM earlier this month.

With the new FSA course system in the fall, I should be able to take 1 course from any track, and so I realized that maybe one of them would actually contain some relevant syllabus material that might clear up whatever is blocking my understanding.

My first guess would be one of the QFI track exams, but I wouldn't know which one is best, so I was hoping someone here from that track might have an idea.

In UL this is general account and it is mixed with all sorts of other money from other products. The overall portfolio earns some rate X%. You also need to credit a minimum rate Y%, but usually you’ll pay out more than this, so the typical credited rate will be between Y and X. When you are clicking your buttons in Excel you’re solving for the value in between Y and X to credit to the policyholder in your projection.

UnitedHealth under criminal probe for possible Medicare fraud, WSJ reports|79|https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/unitedhealth-under-criminal-probe-possible-medicare-fraud-wsj-reports-2025-05-14/|Emergency_Buy_9210|1747317720.0|30|1kn8zee|0.99||"[""I know there are some compelling counter-examples (Kaiser, most prominently) but I'm generally skeptical of health insurers also running hospitals and employing physicians. Particularly in the Medicare Advantage space where there's an incentive to over-code."", 'To add for context and as an example, there is a standardized risk scoring model from Milliman that most insurers with medicare/medicaid will use. It’s pretty much a black box that takes the claim level detail of every member and then assigns a risk score to those members, with certain diagnosis or NDC codes being high predictors of risk (and thus increasing average scores). Apparently UHC was fraudulently adding Diagnosis codes to game the model. This would make it so UHC medicaid members had a risk score average of say 1.2 while a competing insurer’s medicaid members had a risk score average of say .8, even if in actuality the members were equal risk. Each insurer gets the same rates from their state for medicare/medicaid, and then they redistribute the money based on who had the riskier members after all is said and done (as having risky members shouldn’t be punished as this would lead to insurers purposely excluding risky populations). If a competing insurer had riskier members but UHC was gaming their numbers to give the appearance that they actually had riskier members, then they were straight up stealing funds from the government and from their competitors. \n\n\nUHC will likely lose any future RFP bids for new business across the country if this is true, alongside massive fines. Hence the stock collapsing and leadership bailing. Huge opportunity for all of their competitors in their states to take advantage of the market void.', 'Someone posted a few days ago asking what on earth was going on with them. I guess the CEO caught wind that this was coming soon and immediately resigned to not have to deal with it. Personally, I think many health insurer practices are misunderstood and serve a genuine purpose, but some of the Medicare Advantage stuff greatly pushes the limit. Criminal activity should be punished. I hope the upcoding (which is the subject of a separate federal investigation) is reined in.', 'Haven’t they been investigated in the past? I’m also sure other health insurers do something similar; I remember reading an article on Cigna with similar fraudulent claims. I’m not trying to excuse or normalize this practice, but why is UHC being targeted specifically and now?', ""It's a big problem, competition is crucial to making this system work. There's a few contributing regulatory factors that incentivize it including MLR and the ability to upcode at all. MLR incentivizes vertical integration on the margin because insurers can profit-shift from their insurance operations into higher profits at the hospitals they own by charging more. There's also some weird stuff in the Rx space with federal reinsurance that incentivizes insurers and PBMs to merge.\n\nThe good news is there are workable and effective solutions floating around to fix all this, and they don't even require that much change. Like increasing minimum network size requirements (more payments must go outside the insurer-owned provider system to other insurers).\n\nTechnically, if you trace the causes back far enough, it tends to come back to eliminating various forms of medical underwriting as a big distortionary factor. But protecting people with preexisting conditions is very important. Ideally I would want the government to raise the funding to fully subsidize the cost of coverage for these high-risk patients, as determined by full fledged medical underwriting in a competitive bidding system. Then we don't get the weird collusion incentives caused by risk adjustment and reinsurance, and everyone is still insured,  and the system could eventually be expanded to achieve universal coverage."", 'To clarify, Medicare Advantage payments are driven by CMS risk score models and are additive in nature, not zero-sum game like in commercial. \n\nThere aren’t currently risk transfers for Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment.

I do think there are alot of other entwined downstream impacts that would impact competitors aside from risk adjustment.

A DOJ spokesman declined to comment. \nThe probe adds to a list of government inquiries into the company, including investigations of potential antitrust violations and a civil investigation of its Medicare billing practices, including at its doctors offices. \nUnitedHealth is seeking to recover from a meltdown of its stock over its financial performance and the sudden replacement this week of its chief executive officer, Andrew Witty, with its chairman and former CEO Stephen Hemsley. UnitedHealth’s stock has declined by almost 50% over the past month.\nLast year, the company faced a hack of a technology unit that disrupted payments to many U.S. health providers for months, and the killing of its top insurance-arm executive.\nAll of this comes as the Trump administration and Congress look to cut federal health spending, a key source of UnitedHealth’s success. In March, U.S. senators grilled Mehmet Oz, now the Medicare and Medicaid\xa0agency head, during his confirmation hearing on the findings of a Wall Street Journal investigation of practices of Medicare Advantage insurers such as UnitedHealth. Oz pledged a crackdown.\nThe criminal investigation could pose an additional challenge to UnitedHealth in the midst of a deep deficit of trust among shareholders, regulators and customers.\nThe Justice Department’s criminal healthcare fraud unit focuses on crimes such as kickbacks that trigger higher Medicare and Medicare payments.\nThe fraud unit has offices in more than a dozen cities, but is managed from DOJ’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are working on the criminal investigation of UnitedHealth from the fraud unit’s office in New York, the people familiar with the investigation said.\nF￼or years, the unit focused on busting doctors, laboratories and other service providers who overbill government health programs and insurers.\nBut the unit has turned its focus to insurers in the Medicare Advantage system, where they now oversee taxpayer-funded benefits for more than half the seniors and disabled people in the broader Medicare program, people familiar with the matter said.\xa0\nMedicare Advantage insurers are paid extra for covering sicker patients, creating an incentive to document diagnoses for patients they cover. In some cases, the Journal’s reporting has shown, questionable diagnoses by UnitedHealth added billions to taxpayers’ costs.\nThe company disputed the Journal’s findings, saying that its analysis was “inaccurate and biased,” and that Medicare Advantage “provides better health outcomes and more affordable healthcare for millions of seniors” than traditional Medicare.\nUnitedHealth’s latest annual securities filing says the company “has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews,” and flags involved agencies including the Justice Department. It doesn’t specifically mention the criminal, civil and antitrust probes the Journal has reported.\nUnitedHealth dismissed a Wall Street Journal report in February revealing the civil Medicare fraud investigation into the company as “misinformation” and said that it wasn’t aware of a “new” probe.\nNEWSLETTER SIGN-UP\nWhat’s News\nCatch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox daily.

In March, a court-appointed special master recommended that a judge effectively dismiss a whistleblower case against UnitedHealth after concluding the government hadn’t presented evidence that patient diagnoses submitted for payment were inaccurate. The judge in the case hasn’t yet ruled on the recommendation.\nThat civil case, brought by a former UnitedHealth employee turned whistleblower in 2011 and joined by the government in 2017, concerned claims that UnitedHealth submitted $2 billion worth of diagnoses recorded by doctors that its own reviewers determined weren’t supported by patients’ medical charts.\xa0\nThe DOJ asked the judge to reject the special master’s recommendation. UnitedHealth said the finding showed “there was no evidence to support the DOJ’s claims we were overpaid or that we did anything wrong.”\xa0\nWrite to Christopher Weaver at Christopher.Weaver@wsj.com and Anna Wilde Mathews at Anna.Mathews@wsj.com\nMarkets A.M.\nThe WSJ's own Spencer Jakab gets you ready for the trading day, with expert insight into what's moving markets.

They all went down about 50% off of ath (except Cigna since they are just commercial), all changed executive leadership, all missed earnings. United is unique in dealing with a CEO assassination, though it did reverberate through the industry. Many of these significant stock declines have been happening for 6 months to 2 years depending on the company. Some have already been through multiple rounds of layoffs during the worst period. Yet even in those layoffs, which already happened, there were not significant impacts to actuarial labor force. The very few actuaries that I know of who lost their job due to a layoff were already on their way out due to performance or retirement and/or easily found new jobs and quickly. Working at one of these companies now, the focus on getting past the recent performance is still there, but no one is walking around scared. No one is anxious about trend or pricing outcomes leading to disaster or anything. I admit it is very stressful in the moment, we went through it and others did too similar to United now, but feeling like we’re coming out the other side of it somewhat, realizing other than executive changes and a bad year for bonuses the impacts were minimal. I mean we have a bunch of open roles right now too, so not like hiring has slowed. We have a slightly smaller intern cohort this year. In work terms, 2027 is not far away. They may even have some layoffs, but barring a huge legislative overall not yet announced, I think it’s more helpful to reassure fellow actuaries that no matter the perceived stress, it will pass and everyone will ultimately be fine. Fear mongering only is going to make it feel worse. I assure you coming here and reading about how terrible health insurers were, or how bad it was going to get, and about people’s fears of getting layed off, or slippery slope worst case scenarios, etc did absolutely nothing to improve the situation or the mental health of people going through it over the past year for people not at United. United actuaries will be fine. It’s probably better it’s really only them feeling the worst right now since they were late to the party (which I assume most actuaries knew, they weren’t seeing the rest of the industry screaming trend and internally really thinking the whole industry just sucked compared to them), because if layoffs happen it’s not like the whole industry will be doing the same like it was last year, they should get scooped up pretty quick.', ""I've heard about the fake diagnoses but can you explain the rest of your comment?

I recently changed companies and now need to follow the SOA pathway to complete my ASA designation. I still have the following components left: PAF, ASF, Exam PA, ATPA, and FAP.

In particular, I’d love to understand what to expect from the **PAF and ASF** modules — such as the type of content covered, how long they typically take to complete, and how the overall experience is.

My concern is about eligibility for the early-year FAC: If I complete and submit the FSA Module and DMAC by the deadline, but don’t receive my November exam results until after that deadline, can I still be invited to the February/March FAC?

TL;DR: I’ll submit all FSA requirements to be invited to the FAC before the Module & DMAC deadline, but my November exam results will come out after.

- focus on taking exam 7, better prepared myself for my new role, and obviously pay raise. However that would mean I will need to take another exam in 2026 to get ACAS.

But I still wouldn't buy one, because to your point, the embedded spread just tends to be high enough to more than outweigh all of those benefits.

How to be a Great Analyst|36|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ki7n3o/how_to_be_a_great_analyst/|Round_Elk_1641|1746756937.0|24|1ki7n3o|0.92|"Hi, question for credentialed actuaries or other analysts who feel they are performing really well.

**What are some concise tips for how to be a great analyst, standout, and move up?**

Background: I was a very high achiever in undergrad (mathematics) because I was passionate about mathematics and also because the classroom setting brought out my competitive side. Also it was simply intuitive for me to see \*how\* to be a great student. I showed up to office hours with prepared questions and able to show I had already made an independent effort, I studied hard and out performed my peers, I participated in class, and I showed drive and initiative and spent a lot of time learning outside of the classroom.

I have had a few other analyst roles, and feel I have not performed well because I don't feel I am passionate about mathematics, the same competitive nature isn't there, and I don't find it intuitive how to exceed expectations. Math is deductive, if you're good you simply get the answers right and you're the best. Also, write good proofs and other mathematicians will easily understand your work. But in my analyst roles, things seem so fuzzy and subjective. It seems that to be good you should have a lot of emotional intelligence and social skills and figure out how to cater to the right people to move up. Also, it seems understanding the business as a whole and other departments helps (for in house) and I don't know anything about how businesses work. And since me and other analysts work on different things, and no one gives me a gold star when I do a good job, it doesn't spark my competitive nature. I often feel unengaged so I just try to do my exact assignment in a clean way. I feel like hiring managers always think I will perform well because of my academic accolades, but then I don't. I feel like once I am a credentialed actuary and have many years of experience in a role I will probably thrive, but getting off the ground has been rough.

So, please give me a list of things that you did to go above and beyond, or if you are an actuary who has an analyst working for them, what could I do to impress you or make your life easier?"|"['Be helpful. Ask questions, show up on time, try to learn. \n\nThis is a normal feeling. Imposter syndrome is a real thing. Just put in an effort at work and you will start to feel more secure over time. Have people peer review your work, offer to peer review others; whether it be a recommendation, a code, etc. You can learn off reviewing their work as well.\n\nI told my manager, who is new to being a manager, to never feel like he is being nitpicky when I send him something and he believes it could be done better. Communication is usually where actuaries fail — so always try to see if there are ways you can do a better job.\n\nI’m almost two years in and I still have imposter syndrome. I’m getting better though.', 'Get a sense of what looks reasonable and what doesn\'t, check your work, know what your work is getting used for, know what\'s important to your manager and deliver work accordingly, ask good probing questions and be genuinely curious, don\'t miss deadlines (or communicate in advance if you\'re hitting roadblocks), and communicate clearly and succinctly.\n\nYou also want to start building relationships with more senior actuaries and other non-actuarial colleagues, plus actively engage in volunteer events, to best set yourself up for success. These things build rapport that\'s needed as you progress further into your career, as mutual respect and trust is fundamental to fostering positive team outcomes. Investing in professional relationships and networking is super important, but it seems to me like many analysts these days are neglecting these aspects of development. I highly recommend reading Dale Carnegie\'s ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" if you want to improve with your people skills.', 'Stop trying to make everything a competition. teamwork is way better than just being the best (which what seems like you like). Even if you pivoted to studying math full time you would learn that high levels of mathematics are often a team of people studying and researching things... not just solo Einsteining stuff', 'This is sort of a progression and it takes time:\n\nFor me when it comes to promoting someone from analyst up I tend to look for:\n\nAsk lots of questions/be curious\n\nBeing able to understand not just what you are doing, but why you are doing it and why method X rather than method Y. Also be sure you are answering the question being asked and gain some ""intuition"" as to what a reasonable answer should look like. Most managers understand that people will make mistakes, but it\'s worse when the mistake produces an answer that clearly can\'t be right or at the very least would require careful review of everything to be sure.\n\nUnderstand how your work is being used and what it can impact both within actuarial and in other departments.\n\nBeing able to explain things clearly and at least in a way that another actuary who isn\'t familiar with your area can understand. \n\nAnd from there: be able to make suggestions for improvements and show how it would add value to a process.. automation is an easy win but more impressive is improving a model/process beyond simply automating.\n\nAlso there are always things to learn no matter how high up you go..', ""Your job isn't your job, it's to make your team and your bosses life easier. Find where you can do that and keep doing it and people will invest in you."", 'The truth is somewhere between “it’s just like doing well in school” and “it’s only about soft skills.” Soft skills are importantly but to be a good analyst it’s still mostly about hard skills, those skills are just more amorphous than academic ones as you noted. All the other comments in this thread are good advice, but the overall takeaway for you should be that it’s doable, it may not be easy, but there is a path to performing at a higher level. \n\nHonestly though when you say you’re unengaged and “don’t know anything about how businesses work” those kind of sound like red flags. Maybe it’s a chicken and the egg thing where you feel that way because you don’t have direction on how to improve, but if your attitude is that the work is boring and you have no interest in learning about it then no amount of tips will help you.', 'be a sponge, take initiative', 'There will likely be a lot of down time early in your career. Take the initiative to find something useful to do in that down time, rather than just sitting around waiting for your manager to give you something to do. Automate a process, implement a new check, etc etc.', ""Iniative and a lack of fear of failure. \n\nIf you set up calls, lead meetings and ask questions you'll set yourself apart from other analyst as a person who can drive change and lead."", 'Don’t be a nerd ;)', 'I give a lot of advice to people I mentor and all of the advice here is great. That being said, you should keep in mind that you don’t work for any of these people, so what they value isn’t necessarily what your manager values and no one knows your job performance better than you manager. You should talk to your manager to say that you would really like to exceed their expectations and you’d like to know what that would look like.', 'Very few things beat being consistent and reliable...', 'Learn as fast as you can. Be in the office everyday when you start even if you can be remote. Don’t ask the same question twice. Try to answer your own questions, then ask if that’s correct, show us you’re trying. Insurance and annuities can be complex and complicated, try to use your resources and understand how the what product/business is and how it shows up in your work whether than be within a system or a model or whatever; try to connect the dots', 'I think the most concise tip is this: work to make your manager’s life easier.', 'I hate to say it, I\'m almost 10 years in and imposter ""syndrome"" is killing me. (syndrome in quotes cause what if im actually an imposter lol)', ""Can you just message senior actuarial colleagues and they'll agree to meet? Would be cool to talk to one person from each LOB.

I manage a few entry level people. I don’t expect any of them to know anything but I do expect them to basic things like:\n\n1. Not keeping the same basic mistakes.\n2. Give their work a brief review before sending it to me to review. I shouldn’t find a REF error immediately when opening a report you just sent me.\n3. Check results for reasonability. If you pull loss data, you shouldn’t send me something with a trillion dollar claim.', 'This is awesome because fearing failure is hard for me with subjective or non deductive tasks. In my first few weeks I have already found quite a few mistakes in work I was reviewing cause it’s easy for me to be detail oriented and catch mistakes, but when I’m put on more of a research task that doesn’t have a “right” way of doing it I get a little deer in the headlights. Realistically if I just gave it my best effort I’m sure what I come up with would be satisfactory, but since I can’t “check my work” I worry about looking stupid', 'Noted haha', 'What are these things', 'You made it for a whole decade, I’m sure you’re not an imposter', ""It's a lot less formal than that. What's worked for me is showing your face in person and being friendly and positive. What starts as small talk eventually leads to work discussions, then to more structured conversations about what they do, sharing actuarial knowledge, and getting career advice.\n\nI know remote is all the rage and people like to initiate these things online, but being in person and visible helps so much in this regard. Also not turning down opportunities to meet with actuarial leadership, which students at my company have done because they don't want to bother showing up to the office. Honestly, it's so easy to set yourself apart from other analysts if you follow Dale Carnegie's lessons and invest in your professional relationships.\n\nOnce you have more experience and you're no longer an analyst, give advice and be useful to the analysts that come after you.

Drug trends are astronomical, especially with the new GLP-1’s. It’s gotten so bad that we’re building out our rating systems to quote groups with and without the coverage and how to handle GLP-1 specific claims. Long term cost savings are nowhere near the initial cost of the drugs. Premiums will keep climbing if nothing changes :/', 'Can you elaborate this for someone with less experience in the industry', 'does it? arent the net prices still much higher than other countries?', 'no bidens team did not do this, do you mean MFP? that isnt canceled either.', 'This is a difficult perspective to verify but certainly a common narrative within the insurer. We don’t know the actual long term savings yet and ultimately the massive increase in drug trend will not be offset in drug spending, it will be offset in medical cost, so a 50% increase in drug spend vs a 5% decrease in medical costs over a 30 year period is really what you’d have to compare from a clinical perspective. The issue is that employers and even members aren’t purchasing with the intent of paying more now to fund lower future costs that aren’t guaranteed. They see the price differences today and choose to not cover them. Insurers can’t fund the cost because it would be passed off in the future premiums in order to retain the client over time, or the client and their healthier members leave, so you won’t invest in long term health opportunities if you never get a pay off. Nor should investment in long term health be the role of an insurer that can only offer short term plans. Manufacturers may invest in drugs for long term gains because they get patent protection on those therapies and can control costs and revenue based on costs ahead of time. Other stakeholders should fund long term health opportunities under the current market structure. This all assumes there are long term health benefits, obviously not 100% sure yet, it’s not a short term benefit though. Need to continue tracking high cost conditions with these members and factor in costs from complications and those with poor adherence over time.', 'Aon just published a study showing GLP-1s are bending the medical cost curve. https://aon.mediaroom.com/2025-04-30-Aon-Unveils-First-Workforce-Focused-Analysis-on-GLP-1s-Medications-and-Holistic-Support-Can-Transform-Workforce-Health-and-Bend-the-Cost-Curve\n\nIf you assume that 2% of the commercial population consistently takes these drugs for weight loss (it is around that number currently) and the drugs cost $7000 per person per year, that is a $12 PMPM increase for the population. So, maybe a 2% increase in total plan costs? That is obviously significant, but not insane if it is producing favorable health outcomes. \n\nTo me, this is a short term problem and a distraction from more systemic issues. Maybe more than 2% would get the drugs if they were covered? But also the prices will likely come down. Meanwhile, healthcare costs are probably going up 8-10% next year. Plans like to point to specific drivers that are easy to impact, like GLPs, but they are really just one drop in a bigger bucket.', 'Man that\'s so annoying. Is the astronomical increase mainly due to actual need or more ""losing weight""', 'I saw an article saying the plan for NC state employees dropped GLP-1 for weight loss because it added something like 23% trend YoY.', 'So is it similar to how there maybe be seperate coverages for gene/cell therapies or transplants?', 'Pharma pays rebates to payers (technically to the PBM but in Medicare the PBM passes 100% to the payer, in other LOBs they retain a portion for themselves), the rebates are a % of list price and the amount is dependent on the coverage for a drug - ""we\'ll give you a 50% rebate to place our drug on a preferred brand tier"" or ""cover both of our weight loss and diabetic glp1 products and will give you 5% additional rebate"". You can think of it as a bribe for coverage. These dollars are massive. Plans are addicted to rebates, they are crack for part d plans and for good reason, rebates are worth more to a plan than list price decreases. Why? Because the plan would need to share a portion of a list price decrease with other Medicare payers (members, CMS, pharma), whereas with rebates they only need to share a small portion with CMS (this is a generalization but on average it\'s true). So let\'s take a $500 drug and assume a 50% rebate. Member pays costshare based on the full $500, let\'s say 20% coinsurance so $100. Plan pays $400 but received $250 from pharma that the member never sees. Net net ignoring reinsurance it\'s $100/$150 member/plan. These rebate dollars are then used to buy down premiums but the individual member generating the rebates don\'t fully benefit. In the above case if rebates were passed to POS they\'d pay the 20% on $250, or $50 saving $50. Whereas the net effect of rebates to premium may only be worth $10. \n\n\n\nThis all creates an incentive for Medicare to cover high list high rebate products over low list/no rebate such as generic products. Pre insulin price reduction it was the largest offender. Plans refused to cover the authorized generic products due to the impact of lost rebates on premiums/margins. The IRA has muted things to some degree but it still exists.', 'Likely yes, 90% may have been a stretch, maybe 75%. Pushing rebates to POS removes the incentive for plans to favor high list and ensures members are exposed to the lowest cost alternative (in theory). Said another way plans encourage high list from pharma at the expense of their members. Take that option away and individual members taking those products benefit (at the expense of higher premium spread across plan members)', 'I’m in a lot of meetings regarding GLP-1’s and it’s a common theme through leadership (CFO, Chief Actuary, Chief Medical Officer) that while these drugs definitely work, the upfront cost far far exceeds medical claim savings as we know for now. That’s what led to the decision to stop covering them for weight loss. \n\nIt was also becoming a problem on self funded plans where employers didn’t want to be spending all this money on those drugs only for weight loss, so in their eyes as well (because they pay their own claims) they don’t see a ROI either.', 'I should clarify, I’m talking about GLP-1’s specifically for weight loss. We always have, and will continue to cover GLP-1’s for diabetes. We are however changing to not covering them for weight loss starting 1/1/26. The trends are due to the weigh loss portion. We’re giving larger employers the option to rider back in (at the higher trends) if they want to cover for weight loss. \n\nThe problem is that they costs us something like $11k a year per member for weight loss, and a recent study showed that for them to be cost effective long term in order for us to get a ROI (ie decreased claims) they would need to cost something like $100 a year. We just had a meeting with our chief medical officer and she explained it all.', 'i agree with getting rid of the rebate game, dont get me wrong, but I really think our net cost is still way higher.  I dont think ozempic has a rebate to offset this:\n\n* **United States:** $936 to $969 per month.\n* **Canada:** $147 to $155 per month.\n* **Denmark:** $122 per month.\n* **Germany:** $59 per month.\n* **France:** $71 to $83 per month.\n* **Japan:** $169 per month.\n\nbut given PBMs lack of transparency I could be very wrong. and as you mentioned, premiums likely rise which is not the best solution when premiums are already rising significantly', 'Right your comments support what I was saying, none of those people are making decisions based on what might save money in 15 years (a few users not getting complications from diabetes could pay for 15 years of GLP-1 scripts for 100 users, but it makes no sense to an insurer or client to pay now for that savings and non-utilizers don’t want to pay higher premiums either.) I’ve been in the same meetings.', ""You're correct, US is still higher but rebate is certainly not an insignificant amount, will be interesting to see the MFP price on Ozempic for 2027. PBMs are a whole other issue and the reason why we see crazy prices for some specialty generics."", ""agreed, I think if we could truly price index to other countries, rebates mostly go away because they'd have to.  I am not sure it is even close to possible, but I think it would be one of the best solutions to our drug price issues.\n\nedit: basically setup a NADAC but on a global scale where NADAC needs to be within X % of GADAC (global)""]"

Need career advice: Sales to Actuary?|8|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1khky5h/need_career_advice_sales_to_actuary/|yabaldalba|1746692475.0|9|1khky5h|0.84|"
I stopped taking exams about 4 years ago. I completed P, FM, IFM 

Since then I continued down the path of health and benefits consulting (Mercer, WTW, AON) until one year ago, when I made the switch to a value based care vertical within commercial insurance. 

I am selling to consultants/brokers/HR teams who understand the value of an ASA/FSA. My day to day consists of no-actuarial aligned or underwriting work (we have dedicated underwriters and actuarial SME’s). My current OTE/total comp is around $200k dependent on quota fulfillment (60/40 base/bonus), which seems to be aligned with ASA’s with similar YOE as me.

I want to stay in my current career path, so I am struggling with the ROI of continuing down the actuarial path and shooting for an ASA designation. 

My thoughts thus far:
- I would personally value the technical learning aspect the process would reintroduce in my life
- I rate my learning progress / exam success rate far below the median. Especially since I would be relearning fundamentals.
- An ASA title would drastically improve my sales output. But I believe it would mainly be driven by a boost in credibility rather than technical ability (again I would still have the support of actual FSA’s)

I\'m assuming this will also all be out of pocket for both exams and study materials?\n\nUnless you have been told it will explicitly help your sales, I probably would not recommend going down this path unless you are really bored.', 'sending you a PM. Your career sounds very interesting to me', 'Please read the wiki, search the forum, and post in the newbie thread if you still have questions. Questions about entering the field should be posted in the newbie thread.', 'I would definitely make a business case to get study materials reimbursed (50% likelihood), maybe 25% chance of getting actual exam registration reimbursed, and probably 0% likelihood for study time. \n\nI’m currently single with no intentions of settling down soon, so I do think I have time to at least attempt to study/take 1 exam per year to test the waters.', 'I have 6 YOE, when I left consulting a year ago I was at ~130K (senior actuarial analyst but pre-ASA at a consulting shop) but in this sales role it’s very dependent on ability to meet quota (which I did meet in CY2024) that put me right at 195k total comp. If all goes well, I would be around 200-205K for CY2025. \n\nA large part of my consideration can be chalked up to boredom/fulfillment. My day to day is 20-30 hours of prospect facing calls, and general project management (coordination with product and actuarial aligned internal functions). It’s very soft-skill focused if that makes sense, and I’ve seen colleagues with more hard skills (health plan implementation, underwriting backgrounds) consistently exceed as sales people. \n\nAppreciate your level setting in terms of difficulty. My undergrad math skills have pretty much deteriorated at this point, so I would be relying pretty heavily on coaching actuaries grinding to relearn calculus/advanced probability.', 'Go for it then. I think if you give yourself a wider study window (6 months) you can probably make jt work.', ""I think given you passed the other exams, you are definitely capable of passing the remaining, I didn't want that to be a deterrent, just that it will take time and isn't cheap as you are i'm sure aware. You will remember more and pick it back up faster than you think and I'd highly recommend coaching actuaries rather than a cheaper option.\n\nif you do decide to take the exams, it might not hurt to ask your company if they would support any exam/study fees since you think it will be a valuable asset to help sell. I wouldnt ask for study time though.\n\ndefinitely not a clear cut winner and there probably is some safety net value in having your ASA as well""]"

My hesitation is that when I go to take my second FSA exam, I will be ill prepared as I do not have a strong base. I would be going down the GH track. Either way, I feel like it would be important to take the GH101 (GHDP) exam to become better at my job. For these reasons I am leaning away from doing the modules and instead, focusing my energy on FAP and then FA. Are these hesitations valid or am I completely off base. Any input would be appreciated!

P.S. I think I could take three modules from a different track to get credit for one of my non GH exams, but I think taking CP321 could be useful as well.

I would cut the objective section and reduce the bullet points in all your roles - are there things you could combine/remove to reduce bulk without losing much value?

I’ve looked into both health and life roles and feel that health could align more with my data analysis/modeling interests (I really enjoyed SRM/PA) and life could align more with my interest in investing/finance. 

If I switch industries I want to think that I will like the work and will have better career opportunities than I do now. So, if you have any insights on either of the paths, I’m all ears and really appreciate it. 

In terms of timing, if all goes well I should have ASA next year. Is there a best time to make the switch?

"|"[""I can certainly help, having worked in various Health and Life roles in the last 8 years.\n\nMy first role was Medicare pricing. Left due to not wanting to work on Medicare bids. Then I switched to life modeling. I like it a lot and enjoyed the long term nature of the projects. Then switched to healthcare consulting to see how consulting was like. Quickly left to do life reinsurance pricing and enjoyed that as well. I’m about a month away from getting my FSA (FAC Next month) so I decided to pick something and stick to it so I just picked the field I liked the most.\n\nMy main issue with health is that I prioritize work life balance and things tend to be more adhoc and projects come up with tight deadlines working in healthcare. I liked the more chill work and long term projects that I was doing in life insurance.\n\nThat being said, you will 100% have more data analysis/programming projects when working in health vs working in life.\n\n> In terms of timing, if all goes well I should have ASA next year. Is there a best time to make the switch?\n\nIn terms of timing, it would be as soon as possible. As you get your credentials, I've found it is harder and harder to switch fields as you're demanding the salary of an ASA who should have 4-5 years of experience in their field but you're essentially started with 1-2 years since only some of the experience overlaps"", 'Thinking about this also!', 'I really appreciate the response! \n\nWhat about Medicare did you not like?

I’m stressed about timing because I don’t want to have to take a large pay cut by switching industries, but I feel like I would be a better candidate with my ASA.  \n\nI also work fully remote with little desire to work in person, does either industry differ on the remote availability?', 'How easy was it to switch from health to life?

A lot of health roles that I have seen involve Medicare and it seems like something I personally would not be super interested in, but I also don’t know the specifics of the work so could be wrong.\n\nJust to clarify, this is specifically related to Medicare Advantage. The day-to-day work was enjoyable for me, lots of SQL/Tableau/Excel/VBA. The thing I could not get behind was bid season. From April until June you can forget about any kind of PTO and expect to work around 60+ hours a week. This also directly aligned with the spring exam schedule so I had many coworkers that would not take an exam or would be asked to reschedule and even not use study time during this period. During the final week leading up the the initial submission, some people were working up to 80 hours a week (yes on weekends).\n\nIt is also worth it to mention that that under the 2026 FSA changes, they are changing the timing of exams to directly be around medicare bids. ""[2026 assessments are tentatively planned for March 23–27, July 20–24 and November 16–20](https://fsa2025.soa.org/faster-grading/)""\n>Do you think that your last healthcare role being in consulting had anything to do with your WLB? I also prioritize life outside of work, so if healthcare in general is a lot more stressful and requires working more hours, I would like to avoid that.\n\nDefinitely but that\'s mainly due to it being consulting work and you would have busier times of the year. \n\nThere are Health roles out there which isn\'t consulting, don\'t have bids, and isn\'t at a startup and those will have most of the positive without the busy seasons such a voluntary benefits. Consulting and Medicare work does give you transferable skills so it might not be the worst thing to do if you wanted to break into the health space. \n\n>Do you look back and wish you would’ve timed your job changes better? I’m stressed about timing because I don’t want to have to take a large pay cut by switching industries, but I feel like I would be a better candidate with my ASA.\n\nI switched from Health to Life about 4 exams in. Being in the Life space with the more predictable and routine work hours definitely helped me progress through my exams quickly. I wish I stayed there longer and probably would have gotten my FSA a year or two earlier. I would apply now and also apply later. No harm in trying.\n\n> I also work fully remote with little desire to work in person, does either industry differ on the remote availability?\n\nI don\'t think it differs by field. If this is a priority, I would definitely transition sooner rather than later because there are less and less remote roles available every passing day.', ""It's easy if you have technical skills as people always want that. In terms of exams, Pre-ASA it doesn't matter at all since the exams are the same. Post-ASA, experience matters more. I had already committed to the Life track and would still get offers for Health roles because I had experience working in Health. Most employers do not care what track you're doing for your FSA"", 'Can confirm, bids suck. Haven’t had a day off since late March and won’t until early June', 'There is ALTAM vs ASTAM pre-ASA which is the main thing I worried about', ""Ah, I wasn't aware.

Anything 8 YOE or less is fair game in my book.\n\nIf you’re going to request a raise in your current role, your manager probably doesn’t care how many YOE you have. You’ll need to justify it with the work you’ve done and make the case that you’re underpaid relative to your skill set, not YOE.

What are everyone’s thoughts on this level of collaboration?

At first, I was annoyed that they get earlier access than the rest of us mortals.

When changes occur at work, you don’t snap a finger and all your processes are updated. Plus, most people study 2-4 months in advance. Delay until summer is on schedule and gives more time to relax. If you’re a go getter, just look at the SOA syllabus yourself as a stop gap measure. \n\nThe collaboration is welcome to me. Parts of the SOA are run on volunteers and by engaging with exam prep stakeholders who have economic incentives for a good product, in theory we will get a better SOA exam experience product.\n\nI suspect most of the core principles will be the same like pricing, design, trend, valuation, IBNR, regulation, provider reimbursements, risk adjustment, etc.', 'Didn’t you post this already?', 'It would be stupid if they didn’t collaborate with the study material providers ahead of time, especially for such large sweeping changes', 'A couple of quick thoughts:\n\n1-for the exam I teach (old SDM – new Cross Practice 311 Strategic Management), it will go live the day the new exam syllabuses are released (assumed to be later in May).\n\n2-SOA collaboration is not yet on syllabus content … but the collaboration keeps building every few months and I feel once FSA2025 is launched, there will be opportunity for exam prep providers to give more & more feedback on every part of the process.\xa0 But the SOA is definitely reviewing every part of every syllabus to strengthen them which was needed in places.\n\nSteve (XP)', 'Are they going to also release study notes for the new exams?

Do CPA CPE in general count towards SOA CPD?|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kegnq9/do_cpa_cpe_in_general_count_towards_soa_cpd/|Prestigious-Bus-3534|1746354311.0|5|1kegnq9|0.81|Most of actuarial work involve either pricing/reserving insurance products or financial reporting, so I would think most CPA CPE programs would also satisfy any SOA CPD requirement. Anyone with both FSA/ASA and CPA who does this?|"['“In general,” no. But in some cases, sure.\n\nFirst, if you are in the US and you issue “Statements of Actuarial Opinion” (which is basically any actuarial work), you must meet the American Academy of Actuary’s US Qualification Standards. Meeting the USQS CE requirements automatically satisfies the SOA CPD requirements.\n\nThe USQS requires that continuing education be “relevant”:\n\n> Continuing education is “relevant” if it (1) broadens or deepens an actuary’s understanding of one or more aspects of the work an actuary does; (2) exposes an actuary to new and evolving techniques for addressing actuarial issues; (3) expands an actuary’s knowledge of practice in related disciplines that bear directly on an actuary’s work; or (4) facilitates an actuary’s entry into a new area of actuarial practice. Ultimately, it is an actuary’s responsibility to make a reasonable, good-faith determination of what continuing education opportunities will enhance an actuary’s ability to practice in a desired field.\n\nI don’t know much about CPA CPE, but it is plausible that some accounting topics would satisfy that definition, particularly number 3. You might be able to find 30 “hours” of CPA education a year that satisfies the definition.\n\nNote that each actuary is individually responsible for determining which activities count for which credit, there is no governing authority that determines how credits are granted for USQS.  The presenter on a webcast might indicate how much credit they think should be granted for the webcast, but that is ultimately not their decision. And only 6 “hours” of your CE credits need to be “organized activities” - the rest can be self study. I don’t know if either of those things are true for CPA CPE.', ""I have both and unless it specifically states it, the CPD / CPE will not cover both requirements. You'll either have to ask the instructor or check the course to make sure it covers both CPD / CPE. \n\nWhen you go onto NASBA, you'll have to make sure that its registered with NASBA to get the credit. So if the CPD provider isn't registered and the course doesn't explicitly state that it covers both CPD / CPE, you're going to have to do a separate course to cover FSA requirements"", 'Rather than trying to fit in CPA CPE to SOA, it would be better to find useful and relevant publicly available contents from SOA domain and use tools like [CPDproof.com](http://CPDproof.com) to certified for them.', '""each actuary is individually responsible for determining which activities count for which credit, there is no governing authority that determines how credits are granted for USQS"" I guessed as much. The State Accounting Boards are tight when it comes to CPE credits (only approved provider courses count) but looking at the Society of Actuaries guideline, ""talking to Bob, the senior actuary at the office, about the latest IFRS implementation for an hour"" seem to count just fine (i.e. it\'s entirely self-declaration and some might just lie that they did CPE)\n\n\nIf my understanding is correct that the burden of proof for SOA CPD is much lower than CPA CPE, having 20 hours of CPA CPE (with proof) should be more than enough to satisfy the ""voluntary"" SOA CPD (the 10 hour gap can be filled by Bob).\n\n\n(CFA PL is the same way as SOA - ""reading"" counts without having to produce any evidence, so you might as well read the Bible and de facto have it count as a CFA PL.\n\n\nIn that sense I suppose CPA CPE requires strict evidence because it\'s a US goverment certification, and unlike FSAs there are tens of thousands of accountants so an honor system won\'t hold. To put it the other way, I suppose the SOA CPE system is mostly a hobby, much like the accredation process itself.)', ""Have you seen a course provider that tells you their course qualifies for SOA CPD?\n\n\n(cuz I've gone through most looking for free stuff and I've never seen one)""]"

I think our manager got tired of dealing with him, and so now I have to. The guy is basically the embodiment of weaponized incompetence - misses a ton of deadlines, skips meetings because he ""forgot"", spends hours each day eating and chatting with people and goes home early whether his work is done or not, and pretty much everything he works on has mistakes. It's clear that he doesn't give a shit, and it's shocking that he hasn't been put on a PIP or fired. 

I've been made responsible for signing off on this guy's work, and because of all the issues I've had with him, I wanted to set up better processes and plans to make sure this doesn't keep happening because every time it does, I get dragged in the mud with him and makes me look bad. I talked to my manager about my idea, but he said my job is just to review and that I'm not the guy's manager. He said he'll talk to the guy and provide feedback instead; however, our manager is not good with confrontation, and nothing has changed with me still taking blame for this guy's actions. Is there anything I can do besides finding a new job? It feels like I've been put in an impossible position, and I can't ask to join another team because ours is already very shorthanded. 

Other option I guess is to document how this guy's actions are affecting me and report to our manager again, but that's just going to make me look like a rat bitch.

I finished my masters at the end of 2023, so not too far back (as some of my friends who are also pursuing this field have said hurt them).\n\nExperience: As I said, being a professor was the goal nearly all of my college career. As such nearly all of my experience has been tutoring/TA/RA related, some basic retail sales experience (3 years) to pay some bills as well. Of note from the last year-ish was being a part of two “start ups”. The first was helping an insurance broker begin her own practice. She had the clientele, mostly needed infrastructure, IT and general admin help. I still maintain occasional consulting with her as needed. Ironically enough my wife, who was also aiming for her own PhD, has now stepped in to work with her and is in the process of obtaining her broker credentials. The second is a true start up, friend had an idea of a sort of AI-marketing B2B model. This is very much in the development phase but seems like at least an interesting internship type deal.\n\nExams: I know this is the key part. Currently studying for FM/P and plan to take them around August/September. I feel fairly comfortable with the material from my skimming of the syllabus. Likely going the textbook route as from what I gather CA does not seem to fit my style.\n\nIn the meantime is there anything further I can be doing? I’ve applied to countless EL (which somehow always still want experience) analyst related jobs, but no luck. Tend to get the generic “good education, but no experience” response. When I go for more basic roles I was recommend, ie teller, personal banker, accounts manager etc I hear I’m overqualified or get no response. I know the exams hold quite a bit of weight so I’m pushing through with those. My part time tutoring jobs can only sustain for so long (especially depending on time of year). I figure if I’m going to be doing something in between exam time it might as well be good for the resume.\n\nI welcome any advice or connections.

That short interim you mentioned could be very important for helping vulnerable people, and helping to stop perpetuating a cycle of in-prison-out-prison-back in.\n\nThat's another thing I find interesting about this career path: it handles things that people (mainly myself!) never think about.

I can tell you that Actuaries generally make those figures after their first credentials, generally 3-5 years after beginning to take exams. After earning FSA (an additional 2-4 years) you’d likely be in the $130-160k range. My guess is you’d be looking at a pay cut at first, but eventually have a higher salary long term. \n\nIf you like actuarial work, I’d encourage you to take the first two exams (P & FM), and then negotiate salary for something higher than normal entry level given industry experience. Good luck!', 'Definitely an option. Pass two, leverage experience but know your worth to say no if the offer isn’t high enough. Continue taking SRM and PA which aren’t too difficult. Only note is that an actuarial role will pay for exam materials, fees, and allot company study time. That may be worth a few grand in pay-cut at first.', ""Starting at $85k is a normal EL comp if you're in a high cost of living area, ignoring your directly transferable experience.\n\n$105-115k also wouldn't be unreasonable given your experience.

Benefit Rush-Hush-Crush and Recent US GDP Trend|7|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kdbwnd/benefit_rushhushcrush_and_recent_us_gdp_trend/|DrZakura|1746220083.0|1|1kdbwnd|0.82|"\*Not intended to be a serious or political discussion\*

As we know, GDPs are calculated as C+I+G+(Export-Import). And from what I heard the policy issuers are gonna significantly increase the ""coinsurance"" on import in the near future. Could we see the Rush/Hush/Crush pattern on GDP trends as we look ahead? 

Just a random shower thought as I work on getting all these GHDP material out of my head. "|"['Not so much on GDP but on imports absolutely. Rush-hush definitely as companies rushed to import and build inventory in advance of the tariffs.\xa0 If you look at why the Atlanta Fed GDPnow model was so off for Q1, it was essentially because a rush-hush this large was completely outside what they could have accounted for.\n\n\nCrush is possible but it\'s not a given that imports will rise back to anything resembling ""normal"" in time, unless tariffs go away.\n\n\nNeat insight.']"
Insurance for Daycare Centers|11|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1kdajyg/insurance_for_daycare_centers/|mqireddit|1746216631.0|14|1kdajyg|0.88|"I was reading comments from a post complaining about high day care cost but low caregiver wages. Overhead and insurance are the major cost.

Curious if anyone has experience on pricing or coverage of daycare, what does the typical coverage include? Liability of the property for sure, and to what degree on the kids? I would assume the medical liability on the kids account for the majority?

Similar insurance could be there for senior centers too? Are these care center coverages still under P&C if they have life/accident element?"|"[""General liability coverage isn't really for property. It's more liability for if a child gets hurt like a slip and fall. Or with sexual assault, rare but those costs would be really high.\n\nSo it's more about getting sued, which is P&C."", ""I don't currently work in midmarket commercial lines pricing but I used to a while back:\n\nGenerally:\n\nA daycare would likely have two forms of P&C insurance (at the very least). \n\n\n\n1) Commercial property. That wouldn't be seen as much of a risk. No one really robs a daycare and they tend not to catch fire any more than your average small business (although some of them have kitchen facilities and that could increase the rate).\n\n2) CGL: this one can be a killer. Anytime you are insuring a business that has a small child component in it your liability costs in terms of injury, slip and fall, or sexual assault can be very high.. it's mostly a low frequency/high severity thing. Also it doesn't take much of an error/misstep to cause an issue, especially because really small children may not communicate well/will find all your safety vulnerabilities really quickly so failing to call EMS when you should can happen for instance. There are also a lot of legal rules/regulations with daycares in most places and simply causing damage through not following those (by accident) can make for a bad time. Staff are typically not super well trained in these things.\n\nNote I am talking about a small/mid sized daycare facility here and not a very large facility. Indoor playgrounds have a similar insurance issue as do trampoline parks and places like Chucky cheese (to a lesser extent).\n\nAs for old folks homes? At least in Canada it isn't as bad on the liability side."", 'Not a P&C actuary, just a parent, but my husband and I talk about this all the time. I don’t think daycares bring in much revenue to begin with, even with the high tuition. Our 2 year old costs $3150/mo here in California, and I think the student:teacher ratio in his age group is 1:6. There’s about 20 kids in that age group between two classrooms, and some of them are part time (3 days per week). There are four full time teachers for this age level. There’s one class of infants (which has a 1:4 ratio), one class of toddlers (1-2yo) with the same 1:6 ratio, one class of 3-4 and one class of transitional K (1:14 ratio or something). So I think there’s 12 full time teachers and some aides, plus 2 management level, and a chef (they serve two snacks and lunch).\xa0\n\nApparently the company we use has public financial statements - check out their income statement\xa0https://investors.brighthorizons.com/node/14936/pdf\n$2.7b revenue as of YE2024 and only $140m net income \U0001fae0\U0001fae0\U0001fae0\U0001fae0 (edit: fixed 000s)\n\n\nI’ve joked with my husband that the daycare needs a side stream of income, like renting out space for a coffee cart in the mornings or something 😂', 'A part from general liability and commercial property, there should be some sort of workers comp required. This is p&c as well.', 'The caregiver:child ratio is something I think is really under appreciated. While an elementary school can have one teacher per 20-25 students, the nursery room at a daycare is closer to 1:4 or 1:5. So if you’ve got a newborn in daycare you’re essentially having to pay for a quarter of that caregiver’s entire salary on top of some portion of the entire center’s general overhead (rent/mortgage, insurance, taxes, etc).\n\nA friend of mine’s parents started a daycare decades ago and despite employing about 40 people for their small business, they are solidly middle class. Not a particularly high margin business model despite the high tuition costs.', ""I'm a P&C actuary and my sister owns/runs a daycare. This is exactly what she has told me. Margin is just really small, she's paying employees as much as she can while charging as much as the market can support per child. She's definitely not getting rich, as OP asked, between insurance, building cost (loan), food, couple vans to transport kids, there are a lot of costs and she certainly wants to pay her employees more but also very hard to find good reliable employees. Generally college students or retirees.\n\nKillerfluffyones post on the insurance side was accurate about the risk. How many times have you heard about the daycare forgetting about a kid? Or other bad stories of abuse? Makes it hard to insure because it's not only about people coming onto the premises or a product they are selling but also the people they hire.\n\nAs far as elderly, it's actually typically not quite as bad because you are dealing with adults, they can help themselves and aren't as reliant on staff. The staff can be lower per person. Thus can be compensated better, particularly if registered nurses are involved. But they would more likely also buy some sort of medical malpractice insurance depending on type of facility."", '$3150 FOR ONE KID? Oh my gosh. I’m in the southeast and we pay $1300 for my 3 year old. When I had two in daycare it was about $2400/mo. And we aren’t far outside a major city.\xa0', ""Wow. and here in Ontario we complained about the cost of daycare (Canada now has national subsidized daycare @ $15/day sort of) but before that came into effect we payed about $2000/month for our 2 year old. Same ratios. You are right, they don't have a lot of revenue to begin with unless they do things like running before/after school programs and summer camps for older kids where the ratio requirements are 1:20 or selling stuff."", ""What you are paying for your son's day care a month is probably more than they are paying one teacher."", 'I’m sure our center is on the high end; home based day cares are really popular around here, so I assume their pricing is much more competitive 😂\n\nI was so glad to hear the $15/day daycare in Ontario came through - what a great policy. American corporate culture isn’t it when it comes to supporting families - that’s for sure. My company had 3 months paid maternity leave which is pretty good in the states, and I took 9 months unpaid on top of that myself last time I gave birth since we could afford it. Every woman I met at my company was amazed I did that; I did it because I’m from Canada and felt somehow emboldened to do that since all my friends back home took 12-18 months off with each kid 😂', 'Oh I don’t doubt it; not sure how much they cover of health insurance premiums, but like others have said, there are a lot of other costs associated with running a daycare other than teacher salary. A private nanny around me costs around $5k a month (and I think that’s if you skirt around paying employment taxes, etc.), but that just covers their salary.\xa0', ""I just know that the vast majority of daycare teachers work for less than 15 dollars an hour with no benefits and are treated extremely poorly. I know because I was one. Private nannies get paid way more for looking after just one kid. Hint they don't cover health insurance premiums probably unless they are a big enough company that they are legally forced too."", 'And the work is the hardest I have ever done and I live in a state with lower ratios than you do.', 'Yep; as a parent I’m well aware that childcare is extremely difficult and exhausting work!\xa0']"

Then I’d usually move on to the next section.\n\nThis strategy of drilling qualitative questions was fun too because I could access CA on my iPhone whenever I was out doing stuff.\n\nWhenever I was able to focus at my desk, I’d try out some quantitative (mathy) quizzes. Be careful, though, because some sections only have really long, difficult mathy questions. I usually accommodated this by creating quizzes with both quantitative and qualitative questions so I wouldn’t have to do a bunch of hard questions at once. This made it easier to review the solutions to the hard questions without getting too frustrated or exhausted.\n\nAnd lastly, I think it’s nice to *at least* read quickly through a section before you try out practice problems, but don’t get frustrated if you’re not understanding it while you’re reading. That’s what the practice problems are for.\xa0\n\nI took a very gamified approach to my learning, and I saw many repeated questions. I tried my best not to “memorize” the answers but to really understand each step of the solution.\xa0\n\nStarting in September should give you enough time to do it like this!

It got me 80% of the way there with the response. This works in the inverse as well: after writing really ugly code you can use a chat model to help you convert it into a plain English explanation.\n\nI\'ve also had success with simpler adhoc coding assignments like ""write a vba script that will create a new sheet for each cell in a range and set the sheet name to the cell value"" or ""write a vba script that will go through all emails in this folder and save any attached items to this local folder.""

We’re also given API keys to make Azure openAI calls so we are in an era of internal AI tool building. Neat thing about the API call is you can specify which gpt model to use so in your app you might use a balanced model like 4o to explain stuff and then in another part of the app you can call a reasoning model like o3 mini high to get better code result. Companies will begin building a lot of tools for all sorts of use cases from generation life illustrations, accelerating model validations, automatically processing signed/scanned treaties, etc.\n\nFor my day to day admin tasks pretty much all emails or big teams messages are written by copilot now.  Summarizing big group chats has been pretty clutch when you’re away on vacation and dont want to read through 100s of messages. Meeting notes and annotations are done by copilot now.

""Salaries are too high and we\'re having trouble filling this role. Pay for marketing to increase the supply of college graduates, this will help contain salary growth in this area."" Maybe the hot new field gets money poured into promoting it until a glut of fresh graduates seeking experience outstrips the available roles and salaries crash down with gravity again.\n\nLends itself to interesting thought experiments. Fun data projects to explore actuarial and related fields using compensation websites to compare the development trends. Factor \'study hours\' next to data analyst which requires less ongoing rigor. Good learning opportunity to compare to brand new fields which often have sky high estimated compensation, from the first wave of rare talents who could write in their own compensation programs, and this is mostly driven by few data points mellowing out over time.\n\nIf you straight line from 2009 what expected trends for actuarial entry level would be in the future that $69k is a surprise. Would expect higher. The additional factor of marketing to influence more supply is a good working estimate for the flattening over time. Though I do agree it\'s not perfectly apples to apples in that $60k in a HCOL may have been entry level around 2009 and maybe that\'s LCOL today. (Worth the asterisk pointing out that employers from the compensation perspective do not care about cost of living, but instead focus on cost of labor. Argument being an in-demand area there is more supply of applicants and those in-demand areas tend to also be HCOL. That delta between will be different. And the deeper asterisk, work with compensation data long enough and you see that cost of labor tends to lag behind cost of living changes and they are correlated so actually your employees concerns of cost of living are the leading indicator of cost of labor changes.)', 'Col?', ""Tried to get one the summer after soph year and did not, tried again the summer after junior year and I got one with the company that I'm still working for now"", 'See my other comment - I had one internship the summer prior', 'ActSci (very math-heavy for an ActSci degree) & CS double major', '2, HCOL', 'Almost ASA but yup.

I suspect it has to do with the exam committee at any given point and attempts to address what had come before or to improve things or as a way to adapt to changing needs.\n\nNot to say that it isn't harder now than it was pre CBT due to lack of practice questions but I've noticed that for the most part the current exams have always seemed harder than the prior iteration (or at least that has always been the perception) and it's been a constant view for exam writers at least over the 20+ years I wrote exams. \n\nI think there is some truth to it but there is also some selection bias due to some harder topics being removed over time.

I am only passing one exam a year anyway.\xa0\n\n\nAlso half of the syllabus material is a complete waste of time. Why am I learning about using convolution matrices to determine the grayscale of an image? #1 no actuary needs to know the black box working of image recognition algorithms and #2 the source material is from 2009... and in the tech world it might as well be from the 1400s.

THere are some exams from 2017-2019 period that I am glad I am not seeing for the first time as an exam taker. There was no good way to prepare for those, and there were plenty of errors there as well (just back then those errors got called out, now the big problem is that there is ZERO transparency/acknowledgement about how they get handled)', 'CAS exams are not honest.  One aspect of the exam that doesn’t enough attention is the grievance process.\n\n1.  After the exam, you have less than five minutes to write out any defect identified.  You no longer have access to the exam question for reference.  How can anyone write out a coherent argument under such circumstances?\n2.  According to the Syllabus of Basic Education, you have one week to submit any grievance intended to impact scoring.  Again, with nothing in front of you, how can anyone write out a convincing argument just from memory?\n3.  I did submit one complaint for the current sitting.  I followed the instruction in the Syllabus of Basic Education and still got bounced around three times.\n\nDoes CAS look like an honest organization to you?', ""Yeah I actually do fit that description. The big leaps were around 2011-14 where they shifted to higher order questions on Bloom's taxonomy, then IQs, then 2018 itself was a huge jump on 8 and maybe 7. And then CBT made things a little different, not necessarily harder imo, but I only took 9 CBT. Can't speak to what they introduced this year or with the syllabus changes to 7 and 9. Not releasing exams anymore is a big downgrade because to my knowledge they haven't replaced that practice with a healthy practice set so candidates know what to expect, as any decent exam administering org should be doing.\n\nI think they got tougher overall and I think they were specifically designed to be tougher. Wouldn't call it night and day. Definitely MAS exams seem a lot harder than 3L/3F/4 although replacing 3 exams with 2 probably was a time savings for people overall.\n\nOne thing that I came to realize was making previously released exams seem easier for me was that the study manuals tell you which paper you need to answer each question. Some of these exams have similar but slightly different concepts and approaches splayed across several papers. If I saw a new type of wording for the first time in an exam setting, sometimes I really had to know my stuff to be able to know immediately where to go with it without any confusion. Whereas if I saw the same question for the first time because it was, yknow, in the Feldblum section of the RF manual, seems a lot easier because you can immediately see where to go with it. When I was well-prepared for an exam there was a lot less of that sense of confusion and anxiety around question ambiguity and it really didn't have much correlation to how hard the exam was (either judged by pass rate or post exam discussion)."", 'I thinks it’s hard to gauge if the exams have gotten harder.

First CAS exam 2019, last 2024, so I\'ve seen both pre- and post-CBT exams. My perspective has been that the CBT exams are much better written (with exceptions, of course) than those before. The spreadsheet format is so much better for the candidate than paper/pencil/calculator. I shudder to think how much of my mental energy pre-CBT was spent on double- and triple-checking my calculator typing.\n\nI also think the CBT exams have moved away (in general) from ""one weird trick"" questions towards rewarding candidates who understand and can explain the concepts. CBT also allows graders the opportunity to award partial credit more readily.\n\nNow... the huge step backwards has been not releasing old exams. That has ripple effects, as most third-party content used to be built off of old released exams.

This was my first sitting but wasn’t expecting so many proofs as the first three sittings (even October) seemed more straight forward in terms of calculations. I was able to put something down for every question but still banking on a lot of partial credit because I couldn’t get some of their answers and had to move forward with my incorrect ones. The IG seemed very unfair given the 3 previous exams they didn’t come close to a density function that complex.

The relativity question was my worst scoring question I’m sure of it.

I was able to get full credit for a couple of questions and more than half for the rest, question 2 was a total mess if i get 3 out of 10 points i will be happy.\n\nCompared to the last sitting I’m very happy to get this level of difficulty, it was actually quite solvable and the time constraint was okay for this exam.\n\nIf i was to guess on what the passing mark would be, around the 35 points mark give or take a couple points so somewhere around the 55-60% would be very reasonable.', 'It looked easier than I expected.

One nice thing on this one compared to prior exams was on the relativity question and the credibility question they gave you the answer so you just had to show it. But with both of them there were parts at the end where they wanted you to show that part b and part e were the same (credibility question) or that they combined gave you a certain number (the relativities and off balance factor). So if you got that number then you should feel really confident you got that whole question right because that end number used every other part of the question. \n\nOn my first sitting I only felt confident on about 1/3 of it and got a 3. Second sitting felt confident on about 40-50% and left 2 questions blank and realized I made some dumb errors afterwards. Got a 4 on that sitting.

It is kept in case the policy holder cancels their policy.\n\nIBNR Reserve: This type of reserve is kept for the claims that have been incurred but not reported as yet to the company.

A huge part of that reserve setting is understanding the product and what impacts it; creating a story of what we are seeing in the product and reserving accordingly.\n\nI am involved in the role out of new products. Depending, the pricing actuaries may discuss aspects of the product with me or data that we have available or can use. Otherwise I have to determine our reserving methods and that can change based upon the size of the line and the business plan for the line.\n\nAnother big aspect of reserving is the data we use and process improvements. It is no secret that insurance companies tend not to update their technology very quickly. So while I have other people pull data for me (which for the younger actuaries is a good way to give them time to look into things and understand the data), I am the person who can decern something is wrong. I also work with IT to ensure as they move processes over they are working correctly.\n\nSo in general, a reserving role can be great.

Wanted to put a PSA out there so you don’t end up like me last sitting. I ordered my exam 9 study kit on 2/26/25 with an exam date of 4/17/25. Thought I would probably get it in March and have a few weeks with it, but I was okay with that. 

Nope, I didn’t receive it at all. In fact,I still haven’t. I’m not quite sure if CAS uses actual snail mail or why shipping would take +2 months. My coworker had this happen as well & they couldn’t even provide them a shipping number. We both had to call to receive refunds. 

Personally, I find this ridiculous especially since CAS has been sure to remind us source wording is so important. There’s no reason for such long ship times domestically — especially when candidates don’t have the option to select expedited shipping.

I may have gotten some of the multiple choice/drag and drops wrong (though I understood them fully, I believe), and one of the calculation problems I saw a better way to do it (I think; depends on if some information was there, don\'t quite remember).\n\nI think I prefer this format with more multiple choice/drag and drops over more free response questions.  It was always difficult to know what the ""magic words"" were to get credit on those, and I suspect the chances of convincing a grader of a different perspective on a problem are low, even if well argued (and how much time will you take to argue well on a timed exam?)  The all or nothing aspect of multiple choice/drag and drop is a little nerve-rattling, though there was a tweak on them that helped a bit (don\'t think I can say more than that).

I don't know if this is intentional payback for the high pass rates due to technical errors last spring, but the length and difficulty of this exam was beyond the pale in my opinion. This was my third attempt, so I knew the material pretty well and I probably left 15% of the exam blank just due to time since I worked my keester off for four straight hours. I will say I actually caught a lot of the curveballs in what I did answer, but I am so jaded by the grading process that I feel I'm going to get docked enough to not push me over the line without a pass mark below 70%. I'm guessing at a 70% pass mark for CAS-7 will not pass many students this sitting?

Historically the pass mark for exam 7 has been somewhere in the 72%-75% range and judging from the last few sittings and grades people failed with i'd say they have been keeping it pretty steadily close to 75% so i wouldn't expect that to be different, which honestly doesn't leave too much room.

4. I have never learned Excel.
5. I plan to use AMLCR + CA Adapt for a final 30-day sprint.
6. I haven't studied mathematical statistics

I would expect this to become like IT where you don’t have an expected exam progression like you do now. This is because most people will be graduating college as ASA’s.

I think management is going to seriously reconsider the exam structure and place way less emphasis on exams. Salaries are not sustainable starting from such a high base.

You'll still need to complete two sequenced courses, but you don't need to take the SDM equivalent after the ERM and CFEFD equivalents. I probably wouldn't start studying for anything until the fall syllabi are released. You need to know what the revised FSA requirements are and know exactly what you need to be studying.\n\nI've heard stories of success juggling two exams, but I personally would never sit for two exams in the same season. Even a retake of these exams is very demanding, and I would hate myself if I scored two 5s. You also need to make sure that you're not going to burn yourself out with trying to master >2,000 pages of source material and memorize two giant stacks of flashcards at once.\n\nIMO, it's better to focus all your attention on one course and ensure the best chance of passing that course. Give yourself a couple weeks (at a minimum) to recharge and reset before making these decisions.

I remember there are some overlaps on risk management topics but wording and # of bulletpoints vary. I found it was a bit confusing when switching from ERM to FD mindset. Other than that, they are different exams overall. I don't know how you can study two exams together because the biggest challenge I can see is memorization. There are over 1000 flash cards combined. Also, you probably will use TIA for ERM and PAK for FD. I just don't see a convenient and efficient form to study both. Most importantly, it sounds like your study strategy needs to be refined. You should find an effective strategy and pass FD first. Then ERM can be easier since you will have a good and proved strategy by then. \n\nDon't study harder but smarter."", ""Thank you so much for taking the time to respond.

Are policy values appropriate for calculating reserves?|2|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1k7ooz7/are_policy_values_appropriate_for_calculating/|Severe-Prior-6492|1745597214.0|3|1k7ooz7|0.76|"I haven't noticed much discussion on this, and I know in Canada they use other methods like CALM, but is this still common in the US nowadays? I never fully understood why policy values made sense compared to projecting cash flows manually, projecting likely shortfalls, and calculating reserves from there. I ask because it seems policy values themselves do not take into account shortfalls that can arise due to natural random variation, and classic life insurance textbooks like AMLCR state that policy values could be used as reserves for products like term insurance. Like why?

By the way, as policy value, I understand it as being equal to the Expected value of L\_1 + ... + L\_n, where

L\_j = expected present value of benefits - expected present value of premiums (for policy j)

Like to be clear, suppose we work with a 20 year term insurance product. To me, I understand L\_1 + ... + L\_n as being equivalent to discounting what's left over after investing all premiums, paying benefits out of this amount, receiving premiums from those still alive, then investing the rest, and so on... all the way to time = 20 (I'll spare the math, but discounting this amount certainly does produce the present value that equals L\_1 + ... + L\_n).

The problem with this interpretation in general, assuming premiums are payable annually and death benefits at the end of the year (unrealistic, but just for simplicitly), what if benefits paid exceed the amount we have with premiums invested? The negative amount would seem to have to grow at the interest rate too staying faithful to my interpretation of L\_1 + ... + L\_n above. That's not neccessarily an issue (like you could borrow the shortfall at the interest rate), but it seems like a very unrealistic assumption.

Sorry for the wall of text. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks."|"['Are you asking about why the liability discount rate is the same whether the reserve is negative or positive? You need to discount to reflect the time value of money regardless (ie, I care a lot less about needing to pay someone fifty years out vs tomorrow).\xa0\n\nAs for why the discount rate is the same, it really depends on what you think a “reserve” is. Do you view it as the assets needed to back the line of business until the last claim pays out (meaning the discount rate depends on the asset composition) or do you view the insurance block of business (premiums -claims) as a standalone item that should be discounted based on its own characteristics (so the assets used shouldn’t matter in the valuation). This is what IFRS 17 tried to tackle. If the latter, whether or not it’s positive or negative shouldn’t really matter since it’s the same block of business. For the former, yes, expected borrowing costs SHOULD factor into the discount rate.\n\nFor your other two questions, I’ll try to tackle them.\n\n\xa0Both gross and net premium valuation take into account random variation through the introduction of a more conservative margin (moving your CTE of cashflow from a 50th to the 70th percentile for example).\xa0\n\nAs for if benefits become much greater than the premium you need to pay for that (aka gross < net premium), something called a premium deficiency reserve would usually be set up.', ""I think I understood some of the things you said (the IFRS 17 stuff kind of goes over my head, sorry), but correct me if I'm wrong, when you set the reserve equal to expected present value of benefits - expected present value of premiums, if everything actually matches what happens on average (in expectation), you should cover all liabilities without problem. There's random variation though (which might result in benefits payable exceeding the invested premiums we have on hand and the amount we set aside according to the policy value we calculated) (so nothing goes according to average), so to provide a cushion for this, you'll include margins in your parameters for interest and mortality?"", ""Also, as another comment, when you said:\n\n>or do you view the insurance block of business (premiums -claims) as a standalone item that should be discounted based on its own characteristics (so the assets used shouldn’t matter in the valuation).

TLDR: career asa, should I complete my last 2 FSA modules?

hi all, looking for some advice and appreciate any input. I have done a lot of thinking and have decided to be a career ASA (in group health). However, I have already started the FSA module process and have completed the health econ module so far (not sure if I passed it yet, still waiting on a grade), so I am debating if I should continue the process and try to complete the modules before the end of the September.

I'm torn because it took me a what felt like a long time to get my ASA and I only took about a 2 month break before hopping into the modules so I felt very burnt out after submitting the first one. The first module also took me about 3 months to complete because I had a lot of things going on (mostly socializing/hobbies and being busy at work so not a lot of study hours), but I realized that I also spent too much time trying to make it perfect.  I would get about a $2.7k raise if I were to pass them all, but I need to complete all of them for the raise. I am a very social person so I worry that my packed summer schedule would affect my chances of getting it done in time. However, I have been told by others and have read online that it shouldn't take more than a few weeks for each module but with the caveat that you spend most of that time on it/cram.

Part of me also is curious about eventually exploring a data science/analyst career in the future, so I'm wondering if my time is better spent trying to learn skills relevant for that (ex. data bootcamps/training, certificates).

The last two FSA modules I need have not been purchased yet and are covered by the student program.

In a prior life, I worked in capital modeling. An auditor once asked why the model didn't include multiple (strong) earthquakes in the same area in the same year. My answer: we don't insure rubble. 

"|"['As part of some expert witness work, I had opposing counsel ask us to provide a printed copy of a dataset containing full claim-level health detail for about ten million fully insured enrollees across multiple years.', 'Not happened to me, but someone in my team.\nIn a presentation with stakeholders, one of them got mad because we were talking with technical terms.\n\nThe term in question was: ""Denominator""...', 'I had an auditor ask what lapses are', 'I think it goes the other way as well - plenty of actuaries ask about very silly, hypothetical extreme scenarios that make little sense once you take that hat off.', 'My favorite one from the auditor is   \n  \n""we rely on the actuary for this line item. Here is their memo, cheers and goodbye!""', 'I once watched a new B4 audit grad ask our reserving manager to detail our reserving process and valuation models as part of the audit, and basically passed professional opinion after that our processes were adequate.\n\nLove the enthusiasm, but not sure I trust their judgement on our processes.', 'I had an underwriter ask me if there were any TRIA losses. I said “idk, but I haven’t heard about a certified act of terrorism in the last 20 or so years”', 'Assuming one line per enrolee only and 40 lines per page (tiny) and double sided that would be 125,000 pages which would weigh about 1250 pounds lol.', 'This was probably me, before I knew anything. Sorry :(', ""When I'm running, I make many lapses around the track."", 'And given the likely multiple claims per member across multiple years, that could easily have risen to LITERAL tons of data.', 'Nope it was a Senior Manager 🤣', 'Well damn, that’s embarrassing.']"

Any insight/advice? "|"[""About half of my career has been in pricing. \n\nWhile you aren't tied to financial reporting cycles (for the most part), for commercial lines like liability if you work in anything other than mid-market you are tied to account renewal deadlines and volatility of workload which may not be super predictable (other than at certain times of year when the insureds like to be on vacation and not talk to your employer). If you are in a situation where it involves working with a bunch of different underwriters, they don't really coordinate their timing/accounts with each other so it's possible to be placed in a situation with multiple competing priorities which you have no hope of completing every last one on time. \n\nWith pricing in general there tends to always be a drive to grow as much as possible with what you have to drive sales and revenue growth which is a different kind of pressure vs having to finish year end accurately and on time.\n\nHaving said that, a well managed actuarial department would try not to subject someone new to a lot of that and things can be balanced out. With decent people skills and a good manager it can be very rewarding/interesting. You learn about the world and in the case of liability, human behavior and why there are giant warning signs/disclaimers on things.""]"

I'm currently \~300 apps in for actuarial, underwriting, claims, etc. (full-time and internships) and haven't heard back from any. Any help is greatly appreciated!|"['Exams—\nWhy the large exam gap? You passed one sophomore year so I would think you should have sat for others sooner. Also, as an SOA actuary, I don’t like the numbers by the exams. Also, if you want to keep them, at least order them numerically. \n\nWork experience—\nWhy the large gap? Your gpa is not that high and college you have a lot of free time. This is not to insult you, this is to prepare you for your potential questions. \nClerk: does this have a more appealing name? Even Starbucks uses words like “partner”. Some people might think this is not preparatory for a career I’m actuarial. I would also unhighlight 100+ and de-emphasize customer interactions since actuaries don’t work with customers directly. They do interact with management daily.\n\nClasses/projects—\nCredibility needs to delete bullet 2. I don’t see at all how this projects your abilities to a future employer, because it is confusing.\n\nLeadership and involvement— \nLooks like LinkedIn filler garbage. I would make them specific to: what you specifically did, and how you improved it. \n3 other critiques; 1. Delete your 3rd bullet under AS Club. 2. City Coach bullet 1 seems like it’s missing context. Any actuary would imply you didn’t win many games before, because it is not listed. 3. They all repeat themselves. I would start over  completely.\n\nOverall, good first draft and some of my points are stylized and not indicative of the perfect resume, but are one that I would like to read.', 'If you apply to P&C companies, change SRM to MAS-I. Similar material, so you could take either.\n\nAlso, by Microsoft 365, do you mean Excel? If so, say Excel. Word/Powerpoint/etc don’t need to be on your resume. I would really consider if you want to call yourself “advanced” in Excel. I wouldn’t even call myself advanced to other actuaries and I have 5 YOE.', 'Reorder the exam info. Get rid of the retail experience since it’s not directly relevant. Maybe add another project instead. Scale back on leadership info. Someone is only going to spend a few seconds initially reading your resume so it has to be easy to scan for your relevant qualitative and skills. Overall it needs to be more concise and focused. Remove non relevant info. I used kantan hq to rewrite mine and made similar changes. Got a lot more callbacks.', 'If your not getting called back it’s over for me', ""I think it overall looks good.

These are all very good points.\n\nI agree I should've taken my next exam sooner, but doubted my ability to study for an exam on top of coursework. I'll slim down the leadership and involvement, a lot of which is admittedly fluff.

I have been weary to add another project because I feel like three could be redundant but I'll mess around and see what works."", 'Thank you for the recommendation. Unfortunately 0 interviews, and mostly copy-and-paste rejections.', 'Thank you for the recommendation, would you then scrap the awards part, albeit lackluster, or keep them at the bottom?', ""Thank you, I'll give some of the resume graders a try."", 'That is a good point. Well I only looked at the top gpa so likely an employer will too', ""With GPA it really only matters if you're above a certain threshold.

My question is: 

If I pay for the exam on SOA not register on prometric, in the case of no desired date available, can I move it to a different testing window？

Just looking for a bit of advice. I am a recent college grad who is currently teaching, but would like to get into actuarial science. I have passed the P and FM exam this year and was wondering if I should complete the SRM this May. Today is the final day to sign up for it.   
  
I would only have a month to study, which I think might be enough, but I honestly can't seem to find any good study material, especially no material that is free. Is CA really that expensive? Is it worth it to get the lower priced version without the videos and other stuff? 

The next SRM exam would be in September. Would a gap like that look bad? 

The !!!!!350!!!!! dollar price tag on the exam itself also makes me nervous. Not sure I should take the risk and give myself only a month to prepare for an exam that expensive.

First time just wasn't prepared enough, and 2nd attempt was last October which was ridiculously hard. Some suggestions after going through it a couple of times is if you don't know how to do a problem right away go to the next one as the time seems to go quickly on this exam. This one may seem counter to what I said just now, but take your time reading the questions. The added 30 seconds on reading and comprehending the question can save you quite a bit of time. And finally, if you are asked to calculate something that will be used later on (such as a or v and then later asked to calculate the Buhlmann credibility estimate) and you couldn't figure out the first thing you need, use a place holder and state it is a placeholder later.

It’s okay to vary from this from question to question, but take note of how long you’re spending on questions and move on if you’re going way over the 3 minute per point guideline\n\n- Get something down for every question. You may not know how to do every question, but if you can remember a formula, or start answering until the point that you don’t know how to continue, that will still get you partial credit\n\n- There are usually a number of non-math questions where you explain a concept, justify a conclusion, etc. These were a time suck for me as my instinct to write a lot to cover my ass and make sure I left no room to miss anything. Note that the sample solutions are usually pretty concise. Try to get a clear answer down but move on quickly. These are also usually worth relatively few points so they weren’t worth how much time I was putting into them\n\n- Do the exam out of order if you need to.

So, I do think the SOA's answer is correct in terms of the question being asked (PDR as of EoY 20X1), but I agree that their calculation for the LTD block isn't actually correct, as they're taking the total sum of future cashflows rather than a cumulative sum by year.  \n\nI have a question out about this in the MATE Discord, so I'll reply back the answer I receive there."", 'Circling back to fulfil my oath:  \n\nBasically, the MATE instructor agrees that the approach in the Fall 2022 problem is appropriate.  \n\nReferring to the PDR paper, [https://www.actuary.org/sites/default/files/pdf/health/pdr\\_march07.pdf](https://www.actuary.org/sites/default/files/pdf/health/pdr_march07.pdf), specifically pages 24-25, there\'s a line that reads ""If the values fluctuate over different projected periods, the appropriate projection period is the one that generates the greatest reserve value from the above calculation.""  \n\nSo, for the Fall 2024 question, that last-year gain should not be included as it reduces the reserve value.']"

Especially before it's even started. There are tons of similar fields in stats, finance, data analysis, etc. Life is long, and you have your whole life to figure it out. You can work a job you don't like for 1-2 years before you switch, or longer to save to go back to school. You're never out of options.\n\nSecond, college is a big change from highschool and  it can take time to adjust. It's not necessarily about your innate ability, it may be figuring out how to adapt to it and giving yourself the space to do it. Similarly, studying for exams means giving yourself the space to figure out what's going to work for you. I was similar to you - I really never had to try in school to get As before until a few tough college classes, and I got my ass handed to me by my first exam sittings failing P with a 1. I didn't really figure out how to do well in college until my senior year, and I didn't figure out how to do well at exams until 1.5 years into the job (I'm an FSA with 7 YOE now).\n\nYou're in a really good position already having an internship locked down. To me, getting over the exam hump and learning how to study properly is the real hurdle here (setting the math classes aside for a moment). Studying also isn't three hours every day for 3-4 months - it's more like 1-2 hours per day, plus 3-4 on one weekend day, and one rest day for 3-4 months. Figuring out how to study in a way that's effective for you can be a challenge.\n\nIf you want to give the actuarial track one last try, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Take a month break from studying/trying. You may be a bit burned out and overly stressed.\n\n2. Make sure you get mental rest as a baseline for your regular life, too - sometimes this means you can't study during a tougher semester.\n\n3. Stop registering for exams and failing - give yourself the space and time to study the material until you feel really confident in it, and then sign up for the next sitting. Don't put yourself on a clock, don't cram, just experiment and learn *how* to get the information in your head.\n\n4. I'd also recommend dropping P for now and try FM instead. FM is less intense on the math and generally considered easier. Learn how to learn for FM, get a win, and then come back to P with more patience and skills.\n\nFor one last anecdote, I passed P and FM each by studying 5 hours per day for 6 days per week for a month (after knowing the material already for classes). And even then I only passed with a 6/7. I did those hours during summer/winter breaks when I didn't have a job or any other responsibilities. By far, P was the exam I put the most effort into of all of them, and by the end of my exam journey, I passed my last FSA exam on ~120 study hours *total*. Struggling at the start isn't necessary indicative of how your whole career will go. The biggest thing is to give yourself the patience, space, and time to learn how to learn.\n\nIt's also totally valid to say you don't want to put in the effort to learn how to learn, and you're just too burnt out on the whole thing. In which case I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do! *You will be fine* no matter what you decide to do, and you can always change your mind later."", ""To preface this, I'm not an actuary, rather someone in the opposite position of yours where I became interested in actuarial science after graduating and am currently beginning to take exams, so I can't comment on how you can use your actuarial degree/experience (although there are certainly other jobs in insurance for which it is a plus, and if you don't want to stay in insurance, then the skills are also surely transferable to other fields). I can say this though: you have a career and a life ahead of you which will take up immensely more time than what you've spent working towards an actuarial career so far. You still have plenty of opportunity to figure what you want to do. I know the feeling of having pressure that you should know what the future is going to look like for you, but, even if it's cliche to say and hear, you really, really have so much time. It's not as if you've spent decades doing something and then decided it might not be right for you (and even then there are stories of career overhauls). Don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy, especially when your investment is not really that large. Take a deep breath - in the worst case, you can finish your degree and get a master's if needed; in the much more likely case, you will be fine with your degree even if you choose not to become an actuary.

Why is insurance company charging twice for liability insurance on two vehicles?|14|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1k26q25/why_is_insurance_company_charging_twice_for/|jaaassshhh|1744987676.0|24|1k26q25|0.76|"Can someone please explain to me like I'm a kindergartener why the following situation makes sense?

I have Vehicle A insured. Liability Insurance with coverages X and the premium for that is $300.

I ask the insurance company to add a second Vehicle B with the same coverages X.

Their quote is $300 for Vehicle A and $200 for Vehicle B. Totaling $500.

This is odd to me because I can't physically be driving both vehicles at the same time.  That is, I can't go out there and be involved in liability-incurring accidents at the same time in two separate vehicles. And even if I banged up Vehicle1 on Day1 and Vehicle2 on Day2 that's hardly any different than banging up Vehicle1 on Day, getting it fixed on Day2 and banging it up again on Day3.

So, therefore, it seems like I'm paying to mitigate risk that isn't there.  I would think that the premium cost of the riskier vehicle would cover both vehicles.

Is there actual Actuarial Risk here or is the Insurance company just charging twice for the same risk profile?

Asked another way, (and also assuming the driver can't physically drive two vehicles at once) shouldn't the liability coverage be a factor of the driver's risk profile combined with the most risky vehicle?"|"[""There is actuarial risk.

Theoretically,  both cars could be driving at the same time. \n\nHowever, I think if Car A is $200 and Car B is $300 , the weighted total would be somewhere like $400, due to the bundle discounts if the calculation accounts for the fact that you are the sole owner of both cars in that particular policy (covariance adjusted sum of variances). Did they charge you the total $500? That sounds unreasonable from an underwriting perspective, if they bundled the two cars together and calculated the weighted risk. Its entirely possible their system just calculated two of them in a vacuum and then added the premiums.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm an actuary but not a Property Casualty actuary"", 'There is additional actuarial risk here. \n\nThe example you gave implies that you’d be driving the same total mileage despite adding a second vehicle.\n\nI believe most insurers will have a household composition curve showing this is unlikely to be true. 1 driver with 2 vehicles tends to drive more and have more exposure to loss than 1 driver with 1 vehicle.\n\nIf you were instead using a company that charges you a variable mile rate along with a fixed cost, you’d probably see lower premiums than a traditional program if your total mileage didn’t change by adding a new vehicle.\n\nTo contrive an example where adding another vehicle didn’t add any extra risk or cost to the insurer, you’d be pretty far removed from a normal scenario', 'Because people have their poo butt kids and grandkids living with them and they don’t disclose that to us.

FCIA - AICA Module|13|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1k1514c/fcia_aica_module/|Unlucky_Run_4697|1744866670.0|1|1k1514c|0.94|"For anyone wondering about the ICA/CIA module at the AICA/FCIA level:

AICA module 1 - 210 topics, 1 post, 3 memo, 14 quizzes

AICA module 2 - 140 topics, 13 quizzes, 5 assignments

  
FCIA module 1 - 134 topics, 16 quizzes

FCIA module 2 - 81 topics, 13 quizzes



Quizzes are on almost exclusively about the few topics that come before them. They have 4 to 45 questions. Sadly, they are absolute crap. They are full of errors. The only thing, I can say about them is take note of every questions and every answer you try since you cant know for sure which have error or not. They also change the wording which make them awful to be 100% if the answer is correct or not. I wouldn't even bother reading the topic. Just go back once you start the quiz to look for answer.

(Also, the French translation seems okay, but it seems to me that it was written in English and then translated. So some sentences sometimes make no sense. I only did the AICA module 1 in French, after that I did all the rest in English)

Memo and post aren't much either. It simply boil down to write a half page on something. Content isn't formally checked so as long as it is done and about the subject then it's okay.

The 5 assignments from the AICA module 2 are pretty well made. They are the only thing in all of this that take skills and times to do. Mostly R code and report writing. They probably took me, 2 weeks to do, but I over did them. (ie if they asked for one model out of a bunch, I would do all of them (and sometimes even more) and then showed why I took that one.)

Appart from the assignments, the rest can be rush trough.



  
My only comment on all of this is that appart from the assignments, it is all worthless. They specifically mentioned having done some change to augment the academic integrity. They failed. These module as a whole are so badly done that, they are barely better then the SOA FAP (Which is not surprising since SOA FAP are also crappy)."|['Nice!

How to be a better actuary?|47|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1k0zn9i/how_to_be_a_better_actuary/|Party-Ad9205|1744849012.0|18|1k0zn9i|0.94|"I am curious to learn how an early career actuary can be better at their job.

I am an ASA with about 3 years of experience in health actuarial work. Early on in my career, I used to think that passing exams was what set the above-average actuaries apart, but my perspective has changed a bit after talking to some seasoned professionals, and I also realized that opinions vary greatly on this matter.

I have also been asked how I define a ""good actuary"". Truthfully, I am not sure how it should be defined (how can I figure this out?).  I do know that I'd like to have a deep understanding of actuarial work and put it to good use. One example that comes to mind of a ""good actuary"" though, is a professional who volunteered on their city's board to help solve some of their city's financial problems with their modeling and programming skills (presented to me during an SOA case study). I have also found mentors in this space, but don't have a close relationship with any of my direct supervisors that might be able to give me more direct advice.

What are some of the skills I should look to develop as I work towards a more senior actuarial analyst role, and eventually into leadership? I do think I am pretty proficient from a programming standpoint, and also aim to actively work on my interpersonal skills through volunteering and other activities outside of my 9-5. Is experience in certain actuarial subfunctions more valuable than others early on? "|"['The best actuaries can take complex topics and simplify them so that anyone can understand them.\xa0', ""\\- Know the science. The deeper and broader your knowledge of actuarial methods, the better. Always good to be able to pull in new ideas, and it can allow you to be more creative in your analysis since you have more tools available to you. You also want to be able to break this stuff down in a way that is relevant to non-actuaries. This comes with study and practice.\n\n\\- Know the business. At least if you're on the industry side, there's value in having a very thorough understanding of the company's systems. This comes with experience and curiosity.\n\n\\- Know the people. The best actuaries I know have very solid relationships with people in other departments. You'll never know everything, but a good network can really help to add context to data as well as insights not available from the data. It also helps your communication, which is vital."", 'Thanks for the great question. My response echos the other commenters, but I’ve compiled a longer list of the traits of the best actuaries IMHO:\n\n-Technical skills: Can you work fast, in a variety of tools, error-free, with transparent documentation?\n\n-Domain expertise: Do you know the history and quirks of your line of business?\n\n-Creativity and problem solving: Can you come up with novel, yet appropriate solutions that balance established and new methods to fit your circumstance?\n\n-Communication: clear and tailored to your audience, written, graphical, and oral\n\n-Techniques: have a deep bag of mathematical, statistical, and Monte Carlo methods to deploy\n\n-Business acumen: your work is practical and fits its bigger picture purpose \n\n-Leadership: you can develop and manage a team of actuaries and help them develop these traits \n\n-Project management: you can work individually or with a team to lead complex tasks in a timely fashion \n\n-Corporate: you can “play the game” in the organizational hierarchy to advance initiatives \n\n-Integrity: you don’t compromise on rigor or disclosure\n\n-Visibility: you can “market yourself” internally and externally to establish your reputation as a good actuary\n\n-Balanced: You manage the tradeoffs between these traits: brevity vs disclosure, rigor vs speed, risk averse vs risk appetite, etc', ""Shooting for a shorter reply:\n\n1. Develop strong technical skills so you can work independently and figure things out when you need to.\n\n2. Always be trying to do as much of your boss' job as you are capable before passing things back. If you don't know what the next steps are, ask to discuss it.\n\n3.

Knowing where to go for what quickly without needing to ask others can be valuable. And perhaps for this, it is also useful to know why there are different data sources, who uses them, etc.\n\nAnd on the subject of interpersonal skills, do you know who to go to for which types of questions? Do people know which subjects you are an expert on, and do you present as approachable to get those questions answered?\n\nSome other open thoughts:\n\n* Can you identify problems/blockers that affect multiple teams and come up with solutions that can benefit a lot of people? Amplified impact\n\n* If a decision is made to change something, can you anticipate which teams will be affected, need to be notified or included, etc?\n\n* Do you have knowledge of industry or technology trends that may be helpful to incorporate in the business?\n\nI get the feeling it can be broadly described as getting a better grasp of the big picture and building trust and relationships across the company.', 'What feedback have you gotten?\n\nBased on your post, it seems like you’ve been so focused on exams that you forgot you had a day job.

I took the PA exam yesterday and felt good about my answers, but of course, I won’t know if I passed for another 6 weeks. That said, assuming (big assumption!) that I did pass, I’m planning to take both the ATPA and FAM in the next sittings.

Since the ATPA assessment is only available starting June 2, my plan is to prep for ATPA from April 21 to June 2, and then submit the assessment that same week. That gives me about a month and a half to prepare for ATPA.

After that, I’d have from mid-June to October to prepare for FAM — roughly 3 months, minus a few weeks when I’ll be traveling.

Ignore the fact that, if I don’t pass PA, I’ll still take ATPA in June and retake PA in October.

Do you think this plan is realistic based on the prep time for ATPA and FAM?

Thanks in advance for your input!"|"[""that varies so much person to person.  for some people that is more than enough time and for others it isn't enough.  usually at this stage in the exams you should have an idea of what you personally need."", ""I'd say 3 months is a good amount of time for FAM, maybe doing the learn in a month and 2 months for problems..."", ""Prepping for ATPA is cake.

You can probably spend a weekend reviewing PA and 1 or 2 weekends reading ATPA manual. Remember, it's open book, so you can easily re-read the conceptual material that pertains to the task during the exam. Just make sure you still have access to PA manual when you sit for ATPA"", 'Seems good', 'Very realistic but depends on how many hours a week you can actually study and how quickly you grasp the material.', 'I would say this is normal to semi ambitious, depending on the person.

Why are the CAS exams harder then the SOA exams?|49|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1k0kwlt/why_are_the_cas_exams_harder_then_the_soa_exams/|TrafficDuck|1744811405.0|66|1k0kwlt|0.85|Is CAS just unclear compared to the SOA or is the material actually harder?|"['The problem I\'ve always had with CAS exams is the goal posts keep changing. In this way the exams aren\'t ""solved"". This is especially more difficult now that they aren\'t releasing exams starting a few years ago. As problem types have changed and the shift to computer testing and syllabus updates are being made there\'s less and less released content that is relevant. This requires a lot of guessing on what is actually testable and the CAS exam writers seem to find new esoteric foot notes to draw questions from. That combined with no more appeals process and their historically poor question writing makes things difficult IMO. It feels like you are at the mercy of the sitting whether or not 80+% of the exam is covering the core material you know well.', 'I think 50% of the difficulty is genuine rigor (difficult math and tricky concepts) and the other 50% is that takers feel like they have to memorize every single detail of the hundreds of pages of source material. There’s just so much content and increasingly little guidance on what specifically you’ll need to know, so the only safe strategy is to know everything', ""Been a awhile since I've taken the exams but a few things I remember:\n\nA) Lack of resources and practice problems. I think a lot of people get through the lower level exams (and even college) by just grinding problems, but when you get to the FCAS level exams that no longer works. There is not a lot of problems to grind, so you need to focus on really understanding everything and I think this is what trips most people up the most - They need to completely change how they prepare.\n\nB) They get very creative with the problems and sometimes it's difficult to understand what they are asking for.  \n\nC) There is often 1 or 2 IQ questions that represent a *huge* chunk of the exams. If you fail one of those you're done for.\n\nD) In general the material gets very esoteric and complicated, and you're expected to know it well enough to apply to almost any situation. In addition a lot of what is discussed in the study material is just theory, with no / very few examples, so when you encounter it in an exam you may have read about it, but had very little practice on how to actually apply it.\n\nThat said, I always felt the CAS exams were fair. Maybe there was some questions that were iffy, but in general CAS does a pretty good job at making sure those who deserve to pass, actually pass."", 'CAS hasnt released a past exam in 6 years, you simply just dont know how they test the material until you are in the exam room the first time. Past exams are still sort of representative, but not in a way that you can simply just know that material and pass (although i doubt this is the case for SOA exams either even though they still release exams and sample questions).\n\nNeither is harder or easier (probably), just different.', ""CAS gives few resources to prepare and tests like they've given you very accurate study material. I've never taken a CAS exam that I would call fair, whereas every SOA exam I've taken was fair and true to what SOA releases. Lack of info and transparency are truly the most difficult parts of the CAS examination process"", 'Besides the points that were mentioned by other people, I think one main reason people might feel that way is because the university courses are more heavily centered around SOA exams (at least where I went). I didn’t have any exposures to CAS when I’m studying, naturally I went with SOA, which the exams were taught in classes so it was a lot easier & less self-studying.', 'My opinion (FCAS): The SOA has been run as a business with an objective to grow membership. They test in ways that ensure the person would probably be okay in the situations in which they are thrust (specialized tracks). \n\nThe CAS has been run as an academic/research focus first, stemming from the need to standardize approaches to common problems. There are no specializations and you need to know a lot in ways that are not really repeatable. They have been more ""high and mighty"" about the quality of a candidate that comes through no matter how impractical some of the material or questions may be once employed. HOWEVER, they are no longer really rooted in that and alongside the aspirations for membership count and global footprint will come ease of exam, credit for study, etc. \n\n  \nThe very reasons the CAS didn\'t merge with the SOA are the very things the CAS is doing now to ""compete"" with the SOA. \n\n  \nAgain, all in my very biased opinion.', 'Gatekeeping FCASes are protecting their labor supply.', 'The CAS is committed to exactly one thing: keeping the exam content, question writing, and grading process as nebulous and secretive as possible. That combined with some extra mathematical rigor and a massive amount of content on each exam makes them harder.', ""I think you would need one of the rare people who has taken both to get an honest opinion. My SOA friends described their system and I don't envy it. One friend told me their experience with modules was horrible and he'd rather have taken exams the whole way and I'm inclined to agree. He also said they could be asked literally anything from a huge amount of material and I'm like...well...that's similar to my experience, too."", 'As I am sure others have mentioned, CAS has no instant grading and does not release past exams.

CAS’s lack of transparency is frustrating, there’s no point pass marks, no clarity on defective questions, no failure feedback, and no released questions to show how new material is tested.\xa0\n\nTheir content outlines are vague, just listing source chapter titles. SOA’s prelim exams have question banks without NDAs, unlike CAS’s CBT-era. Both exams are tough, but CAS’s….sighs.', ""From what I've heard, CAS isn't exactly the best when it comes to transparency.\n\nI'm planning to take MAS-I in the near future, and I'm hoping that it's doable in terms of expectations and questions."", 'This is just my experience but contrary to some of the other comments here, every CAS exam I\'ve taken that I was even moderately prepared for was very straightforward.  I\'ve never been surprised by what was on the exam as a whole or felt the exam was ""unfair"".  There might be one or two more ambiguous or niche questions, but you typically can miss between 1/4 and 1/3 of the points on the exam and still pass, so those aren\'t really a big deal (especially with partial credit).  And I only started the CAS exams after they switched to CBT and became less transparent.\n\nI think the CAS exams are relatively harder, not because the material is significantly more difficult, but because of the way they test the material.  (At least at the ASA/ACAS level, no idea on the FSA exams)  The CAS exams try, to a greater degree, to require candidates show an understanding of the material, rather than rotely redoing the same Adapt problem you\'ve seen 20 times before with slightly different numbers.  Even though I\'m on the CAS side now I took STAM (which at the time was probably the second most difficult ASA exam) and it was significantly easier than any of the ACAS exams because of that.\n\nBTW, you\'ve made several posts in the last few days about deciding between CAS and SOA.  I wouldn\'t let an extra year or two of travel time for the exams dictate what you do for the next 30 - 40 years of your career.

I bought a second book hoping it would explain things better and so far it has. Though the first is very good for just formula crunching. It has a more math flavored approach rather.\n\nAnyway, I am rambling. Seems a lot of advice I see is also just crunch problems and focus weaknesses.

In-Person vs Virtual FAC153|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jzmwcm/inperson_vs_virtual_fac153/|Any-Blacksmith7061|1744706332.0|1|1jzmwcm|1.0|"Hi Everyone! Hoping to get some advice and experience sharing here --

I will be doing FAC153 but am debating if I should do it in-person or virtually. I have read the other relevant posts but hoping to get more feedback. I am currently unemployed so will need to pay everything out-of-pocket. With the in-person FAC, I will have to cover the more expensive fee + hotels + transportation myself, which is quite a lot. I've seen mixed feedback in other posts on whether it's worth it to pay for the in-person experience. My questions are:

1. What do you like the most about the in-person FAC? Would you say the networking part or any other highlights justify the costs?
2. Does anyone know if there's any financial support the SOA offers?
3. I just got the FAC invitation link but I don't see the hotel booking link. How much does the hotel typically cost? The FAC 153 location doesn't seem to have too much other hotel options nearby, so I most likely would just stay at the hosted hotel.
4. Is the banquet and after-party worth to stay (as that'd generate an extra night of hotel cost)?

Thanks a lot!"|"[""I cant speak to in person but I did virtual and don't regret it and my company would have paid for in person FAC. I would just take an actual vacation with the money instead if you have to go out of pocket.""]"

1. Why doesn't EDB\_t (O21) need to be multiplied by q\_{55+t-1}\^(d) (N21)?

Since EDB\_t is the expected value of the death benefit, I think column O should be multiplied by column N.

For example, O21 should be  0.001993\*MAX((O6-N6),0)

  
2.Why is T22 not = T21\*(1-N21)\*(1-0.05)?

The solution of CA is T22=T21\*(1-P21)\*(1-0.05)

I'm a Venezuelan actuary, and I want to show you an exam from the course *Matemáticas Actuariales I*. This exam focuses on single-life contingencies and follows directly after the Mortality course.

Choosing Between SRM and FAM – Career Changer, Not Working Full-Time, Have More Study Time|23|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jykkcc/choosing_between_srm_and_fam_career_changer_not/|KubricksMyFlatmate|1744585436.0|16|1jykkcc|0.93|"Hi everyone,

I know this question has come up a few times in this thread, but I wanted to ask specifically about my own situation. I'm a career changer and currently not working full-time, which gives me the flexibility to dedicate a significant amount of time to studying.

I’ve passed Exams P and FM, and I’m now deciding between taking SRM or FAM next. Here are the two paths I’m considering:

1. **Take FAM next** – Since I have extra time right now, I could take advantage of it by tackling FAM, which has a lower pass rate and is generally considered more challenging. However if I don't secure a job soon after,  (and please correct me if I'm wrong) I don't know if I should take ALTAM or ASTAM since they're more industry specific. In that case, I'd then take SRM.
2. **Take SRM next** – This exam has a higher pass rate, and I’d likely be able to pass it more easily, adding another exam to my resume sooner. After SRM, I could move on to studying for PA, which is the next exam everyone recommends, and I would help keep my momentum going.

Given all this, I’d really appreciate any insights or advice on which route might make more sense in my situation.

Thanks in advance!"|"['I’d do FAM next. If you pass SRM and still don’t have a job yet, PA is like $1,200 while ALTAM is only $500.', 'I would say FAM first just to reinforce a lot of fundamentals of insurance in general before interviewing. Lots of entry level interviewers will ask hypothetical questions about certain products they may be working on and ask you to identify the main risks associated with the product. FAM will absolutely help with this!\n\nMake sure to put “Sitting/Writing exam FAM— July 2025” somewhere on your resume while you apply! Even though it seems silly to do it, it really helps drive the point home to the interviewer that you are very committed and disciplined to go down this track. \n\nAlso, I wouldn’t completely rule out taking MAS1 on the CAS side unless you are certain you want to go SOA. \n\nI’m the actuarial tutor at my university and help people secure internships and first jobs all the time, so I’d be happy to help more if you’d like to chat.', ""FAM for sure. If you don't get a job with P and FM, SRM ain't gonna do wonders for your resume. But knocking out FAM will save you a lot of headache down the line.

It’s easier and materials are not too much, while FAM is a total beast. PA is basically SRM with a case study and written answers, so even if you take PA a year later your memories will come back.

I ask because you might already have credit for SRM. I was making that same choice and was about to take SRM until I found out I already have credit for it.

For majority of people, I’ll recommend this if yr goal is to secure a job. This is pretty gd and a quick fix. This exam is still quite a leap from p & fm, don’t underestimate it, lots of reading + being able to do the statistical math. If P & FM is like level 5, this is like level 7.\n\nFAM —> More challenging, heavy content on FAM-S and FAM-L. If you’re confident in the material and you’re pretty academic per say, go for this one. If you’re learning the material for the first time, strongly no for this one. Huge jump from p & fm. If you’ve done it bef in college and somewhat understand it, yr chances are higher. Qns can hard in this one when they jumble the concepts all tgt. FAM + college mods takes about a year to master the concepts well. If P & FM is like level 5, this is like level 8.5. \n\nAlso depends when you’re sitting for the exam too!', ""I'd say SRM since the extra exam pass with the easier exam will make your resume more appealing sooner and thus could help you land the job sooner. You really want to just get a job and start earning experience as soon as possible so I think the rest of the factors going into this at your stage in the game are not really as important."", 'thanks for your insight, appreciate it', '“Sitting/Writing exam FAM— July 2025” is a great idea and not at all silly.

That's really nice of you. I'd love to chat with you more. Thank you!"", 'Thank you for your insight — I really appreciate it. Just to clarify, are you suggesting that having FAM on my resume would be more impressive than SRM? Would having three exams including FAM stand out more than having three exams with SRM?', ""I agree with this one. Even if you have to come back to SRM material later when you do PA, that's not that big of a deal. The FAM syllabus is a beast in comparison."", 'DM me any questions and hopefully I can help :)', 'Oh yes, for sure. If you can put FAM on your resume, that will be meaningful.']"

Im having trouble articulating what I mean exactly, but the general notion is two fold. First, how much better is your model at predicting “reality” with the added complexity compared to keeping it simple (some bias/variance notion but empirically tested specifically with actuarial life/annuity models)? Second, is a particular feature “worth” the cost? Could a company using 19th century models with so much bias they can be computed with a hand calculator do just as well as one using models with thousands of parameters and tons of compute? How do you measure the actual competitive edge gained with each unit of additional model complexity? Etc."|"[""My opinions based on experience.\n\n1. I don't think actuaries have the time or energy to create two models and then spend time months later to determine which one was better than the other, especially if it's an ad hoc model.\n2. Complexity is only worth the time and energy if it's justifiable (does not have to be empirically justified) during the model design process.\n\nActuarial models are on the simpler side, and this is supported by what we see in exams, textbooks, and ASOPs."", 'There are cases when you have a ""heavy"" model and a light one that was proven is close enough.

For them, there could be significant benefits to more complext modelling of lapse behaviour.\n\nCompare that to say, a universal life product, where the surrender value is just the client's own fund value. Here, typically the product doesnt care much about lapses, at least not after the first 5-10 years. For this product, a much more approximate/simplified lapse assumption would be fine.\n\nThere are a lot of variables and assumptions in most actuarial models, and probably everything short of stochastic modelling with interdependent assumptions is going to be more complicated in some areas, and more barebones in others.\n\nCost and willingness to implement usually comes down to management and the company's attitude.

Looking for some advice.  About 4 YOE and about once a year my supervisor will expose me to some actuarial modeling software (GGY Axis / MG-ALFA) And I can’t find the motivation to learn it or perhaps I simply don’t have the mental capacity. Usually they stick me on a project for a week or two realize I am making very little progress and put me back into the projects that just use Excel. My Excel skills are prob a little below average but good enough to get where I need to go, generally speaking.

Can I make it as an actuary only operating in Excel?  I’m passing exams at a reasonable rate and feel like I am generally keeping up with my peers in other areas.  I am a career changer with no coding / software background and I feel even the online tutorials I find assume I know things I simply don’t know.

Has anyone had similar experiences and how did they overcome it?"|"[""Your manager sounds like an idiot honestly. No one can grasp actuarial programs like Prophet, AXIS, etc. In two weeks. It usually takes a week just to get through the tutorial and that's if you're grinding it hard. Also the tutorials are mostly useless and you usually will have another actuary on your team guide you through the program/ model the first few times\n\nIf you're looking at a new model, no matter how many YoE you have, its gonna take you more than a week to even understand it much less make changes / model things\n\nI would recommend not beating yourself over this. Try to learn as much as you can with the limited time you get on the software. If you have a license and some free time, try to make a copy of the model and play around in it. Thats how you learn the software, the model and the underlying assumptions of the product. Also I'd go through the documentation on the particular model your team uses e.g. term, whole life, etc."", 'You can get away with it but it’s probably not advisable. Most entry to mid level roles require some proficiency in the software your company is using, even if it is just simply setting up the models inputs, clicking buttons and extracting results. Some companies will have large modeling teams that are responsible for the actual development of the model so as a user you probably don’t need to know much of the technical details.\n\nWith that said you’ll want to move out of most IC roles so you aren’t in the day to day model work. And to supplement probably sharpen the business knowledge too. Like if you’re the company’s expert on reserving or offshore capital then it matters less if you know the models, although it’s often annoying for the little guys to have to explain to management why something takes longer to implement or is simply impossible.\n\nTry to spend more than a week or two with a model and lean on your coworkers where you can. It shouldn’t be that hard to become a semi decent user but I totally get your frustration. I’ve been a Prophet user for years and I’ve spent a couple weeks in AXIS and feel like I just started as a student again.', 'You can make it only in Excel most of the time, but you’ll probably least need some SQL and to understand a few tools just to wrangle data that’s too big. Other projects will come up that utilized different tools, so you need to be able to understand the software well enough to at least know what’s going on, but at that point you’ll be able to make modifications and us it. Learn some R and Python which is more fun and broadly applicable.', ""It's a little concerning that it sounds like you're behind in most areas and struggling to make progress with the basics, especially after 4 YOE. \n\nIt's probably worth your time in the evenings and weekends to practice software, Excel, and data manipulation for a while."", 'The learning curve for actuarial software can be pretty steep, especially if you don’t have much background knowledge of the calculations that are taking place, the product mechanics, etc.\xa0\n\nMost tutorials that are created by the software companies are also, IME, not very useful in the real world. For example, I recall both my initial training on MGALFA and AXIS to be setting up a new business product. When I started working at a job though, my first exposure to a real model was an inforce model (and a really old model that had been dragged from version to version, with lots of legacy code with no documentation).\xa0\n\nIt takes several passes with a model to understand what’s going on more generally with the software, and often you do need someone who is familiar with the software to be available to answer easy questions (for example, I remember in older versions of MGALFA, there were buttons that you could click to open new input screens, except the button did not look like a button at all, so you’d have no idea to even click it if you didn’t know you were looking for it).\xa0\n\nI think the tutorials are still useful, but you need to go back to them a few times inbetween looking at real models.\n\nMy general recommendation for new students is to find an existing model (and to do this during some downtime/not when a deliverable is imminent), and simply document the data/inputs and assumptions. Or if some model documentation already exists (good models should, but in the real world, sometimes documentation lags), go through it and see if you can find those inputs in the model and check them off so you know where to find them. Or if some updates have been made to the model, but the documentation is outdated, offer to update the documentation.\xa0\n\nMany companies have annual assumption update processes, and every software should have a model comparison function, so if you can get a copy of the current model and a copy of a backup model from before the changes, you can do the compare and see where the changes were made.\xa0\n\nFor more open box software like MGALFA, digging into the formula database can be a little trickier, so for that, I would ask a colleague or manager if you can sit with them (or have them screen share) sometime they are working in the model and ask them to simply talk through what they are doing. You can learn a lot just watching someone else do something. Then ask for a copy of the model and see if you can replicate it yourself on your own.\xa0\n\nFor more black box software like AXIS, I think there are audit reports and other things like that that the software can produce to show calculations. Ask someone you work with how to create these reports (for MGALFA, I find the Debug screen to be useful, ask someone how to look at that and navigate between variables).\xa0\n\nAll that said, I do know actuaries who have never had experience modeling. I wouldn’t necessarily advise it though. Modeling provides a lot of job security IME. Otherwise, you will need to find another niche and it’s likely more knowledge based than technical.\xa0', 'Actuarial software can have a pretty steep learning curve. IMO it’s not something you can just get thrown on for a one-off project and know what you’re doing especially if you aren’t provided appropriate training. \n\nIf you are content with your role and just using excel then you are probably fine but if you are looking to switch jobs in the future then I would expect that with the more experience you have, the higher likelihood a company is going to expect you to be familiar with some form of actuarial software, so I would keep that in mind.', ""As you progress through your career, you're not expected to know any minute detail of the models you come across, but you should be able to grasp the general concept of it, and be able to review and question the results. With AI and all, this skill becomes even more important,  you might be handed a black box and a guide and asked to figure it out."", 'Yeah the tutorials just seem to glaze over things.  I feel like I need a two week in person training session with a specialist to get off the ground and then start playing around on my own.  \n\nMy supervisor is not an idiot.  I think my company just doesn’t have a ton of resources to dedicate to training and they want to expose me to something different when they can.  But with someone like me who has below average technical skills - it just seems like I need more handholding than they are openly willing to provide.  I feel like I have indicated my struggles - and the general response is “just keep playing with it and it will start to sink in.” In the mean time I’m stuck in a tab for 30 minutes because I can’t figure out how to exit without saving.', 'I guess your comment confuses me.  Are you saying that actuarial software like MG-ALFA is the basics? Even given that I have been exposed to it very little?  Because excel is fine.  Like I said slightly below average compared to others with 4 YOE. But when I started with my background I would have graded myself WAY below average compared to others with 0 or 1 year YOE. So I am catching up relative to my peer group - because I model in it almost every day. \n\nI certainly wouldn’t say I am behind in most areas and my yearly reviews do not indicate that as well.  Technical skills specifically in unfamiliar software do not come naturally to me.  Seems like I just need to spend free time grinding - maybe a sit down with my direct supervisor.', 'Thanks for the thorough response!  A lot of this makes sense and I will look for opportunities that align with some of your suggestions.', ""I'm reading between the lines a bit here and maybe incorrectly. And I've also never worked in any of the softwares listed, so caveats.\n\nAt 4 YOE I'd be expecting you to have the overall work context to figure things out a bit more. But also in general it's a bit of a flag that they don't have you push through to learn the technical stuff, the work just goes to other people. And if you prefer Excel, but still feel behind in that too, that could be a problem. You should be making up for a lack in other skills by being outstanding in Excel or some other aspect."", 'It’s a fair point.  I think my company (at least my department) has somewhat limited resources so they probably haven’t let me learn when I struggle as much as other companies would.  \n\nBut context matters, management knew my background when they hired me, so while you might see me being slightly below average in excel as a negative, I am reasonably certain they do not.

One thing I can’t shake off is feeling behind my peers with exam progress, I have 6 years of experience and I’m still an exam away from ACAS. It truly doesn’t seem like end is near. I’m just feeling exhausted of “sorry I can’t do xyz, I have to study” and “how many exams do you have left.” I don’t hate the actual work I do and I get solid reviews at year end so I’m not seriously considering a career change at this point. Just ranting to the one group who understands. |"['I am mid thirties ASA still working on exams. Failed the first FSA exam twice now! I am sick of my life being centered around studying 8 months of the year. My wife is sick of it too. Use me as a lesson of where you do *not* want to be, and get to studying my friend!\n\n(Now back to my practice problems)', 'I was in a somewhat similar spot, I’ll share a bit of my perspective. I took a 2.5 year break after getting my ASA and subsequently failing my first FSA exam. I thought at the time I was 90% going to be a career ASA, and I was pretty badly burnt out. In some ways I regret taking the break (thinking about how I could theoretically have finished by now) but I think it was necessary at least in part.\xa0\n\nAbout 1.5 years ago, I decided to retake the FSA exam and ended up passing. Now that I’ve passed one FSA exam, I feel like finishing is way more attainable (albeit still a massive grind). I’m still 2 exams away but I see the light at the end of the tunnel: just one more exam, then one more after that.\xa0\n\nI have heard a lot of people (outside the actuarial realm) raise issues about how long it takes to go back to school, or train for something, etc. to be met with others telling them that the time will pass anyway. Obviously how you feel during that time still matters, but considering that has been helpful for rationalizing continuing to take exams.\xa0', 'So I played “get to work” after someone recommended it on this subreddit and unironically, I do feel more motivated, because life is sometimes about grinding the corporate ladder, and this exams are just another step', 'I became an ASA in 2018.

Company is going to support me but then work picked up as well as having two kids leaves me with no time.

So on a day like today I'll study a few hours in the morning, then I'm having family over for lunch, then I'll maybe study for another hour or two, and the rest of the afternoon/evening is for me. This might not be the best strategy, but it keeps me sane. \n\nAnd if it helps to compare, I'm at exactly 8 years experience (with 9.5 years of exams, passed the first in November 2014) and am two exams (plus the new PCPA requirement + professionalism course) away from ACAS. Exam-wise, I'm at the lowest tier of actuary. It sucks, but I'll keep plugging away at it because I ultimately think it's worth it.

So they would know the only way out is through the finish line. The sooner the better.', 'I was trying to find the source material for the SOA GI exams but have not been successful so far.\n\nthe rate making and reserving exam lines up with CAS exam 5. the source materials used in 5 are widely available and a decent read. the regulation and financial reporting exam lines up with exam 6 but I again couldn’t find the source materials from the SOA. Exam 6 from the CAS has a lot of sources that are very easy to obtain. Exam 6 however is a pain (I have taken it 6 times now…) it is a bunch of material that loosely relates and you have to memorize things that you will always have directions for when preparing in your day to day job. And I find the wording of their questions odd (but that is probably a me thing) I personally would say I learned most of the material from 5&6 on the job and the exam just solidified it for me.\n\nSwitching to the CAS could be a quicker path for you seeing the exam # and the additional modules. The MAS exams are brutal, that took me 3x getting a 5 my first try. But they have gotten less brutal as they took away the guessing adjustment. That is what got me.\n\nDepending on the company you work for, you may need to have a P&C role to be supported exam wise so that is another hurdle as well. I was fortunate that my company has life, annuities, P&C, and pension. And when i switched to P&C i had the option to switch back to life if i wanted (and they had me finish my ASA while starting working in P&C because there was a curriculum change for the ASA where if I stopped but switched back I’d end up taking more exams.\n\nI hope some of my commentary was at least semi helpful. You seem like you might be at a stop where it would be opportune to switch.']"

Is there a 100% ethical sector of insurance to work in?|70|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jxn4d1/is_there_a_100_ethical_sector_of_insurance_to/|Gman4TheWin|1744480354.0|68|1jxn4d1|0.74|"This is a serious question I've been considering, and frankly the only thing so far in my journey that's made me reconsider the profession. I'm currently planning to focus my career on the life side, but looking more into typical practices of life companies makes me feel grossed out. The biggest thing for me is the sale of permanent life policies (whole, universal, etc.) to those who, 95% of the time, would be better off with a different product. I don't particularly enjoy this practice, and understanding that these higher-cost for the insured (but higher return for the company) products have been emphasized due to the nature of their return is just weird to me.

Obviously, corporate greed is nothing new to the world. But for insurance companies to suffer from it seems especially wrong. These are corporations people ought to expect have their back (as their advertisements/public image try so hard to portray). In considering other sectors, it seems that they all suffer from similarly greed-related issues (delayed/denied claims, bad products, fear-based advertising, etc.)



Do you guys think there's truly any insurance sector/insurance company that is free of these issues? Or does working in this industry mean having to make peace with some of its failings?

Is the good that insurance companies provide enough to outweigh their moral shortcomings?

And finally, obviously some companies have more or less ethical practices than others. But does the choice to work at a ""more"" ethical company relative to others justify supporting bad business practices?

If it makes you feel better, people who buy universal life insurance tend to be higher income individuals looking for the tax advantaged growth, not the insurance component.\n\n\nAlso, no one is forced to buy a permanent life insurance product in the same way they're forced to buy health or car insurance because term is so available and cheap. Term is barely worth selling on its own due to its high capital requirements and relatively low returns.

I have tried to use my voice in my ethically fraught industry to inform myself and stand against unethical practices.

I'm not shitting on other actuarial fields - I haven't experienced them so I don't know. \n\nInsurance inherently has tension - people want to pay less for policies but they want more coverage and higher payouts. Insurance companies, laws and regulations have to find the balance. Insurance absolutely betters society - but you will generally see the day to day tension points rather than the overall benefit. Large parts of the world simply couldn't function without insurance. Lives could be ruined in the blink of an eye without it. We don't see the world where insurance doesn't exist so we can't easily relate to its benefit.\n\nOn another note - corporate and consumer greed are the foundations which have create the modern economy and all the freedom and health that comes with it.

Also, feel free to message me directly if you'd like me to share the company name and give your thoughts on their work.. |"['Large account pricing is developing premiums using the account’s own loss history. You do this by developing historical ratios of trended ultimate losses to exposures (“loss rates”) and then applying a selected loss rate to your prospective exposures to get an expected loss for the upcoming year. You then load that for expenses, profit, etc. to get a premium. These accounts may also have features like large deductibles, SIRs, aggregate deductibles, etc. Large account pricing roles often work closely with underwriters.', 'It’s interesting role but heads up - if you liked predictive modeling and data science courses in school, you won’t have much opportunities to use those in large account pricing role.', ""A couple of the big things about working with large accounts is that, depending on the carrier/segment, they can be pretty heterogeneous risks.   Adjustments may be necessary to account for the unique attributes of the individual accounts.   Pricing is heavily influenced by the account's historic experience...but you also have to be cognizant of considerations about credibility and development of a sometimes very small number of claims.\n\nYou work closely with your underwriters, and you have to learn a balance between helping them out, and challenging them on the need to be adequate for the risk being considered.\n\nFor the largest accounts, where you might be excess over a large retention, you start getting into having to give serious thought to covering the cost of capital you will be tying up should you write a particular account, and perhaps some thought regarding what you're doing in terms of developing an aggregation of risk.\n\nFor the right actuary, it can be fascinating work.  And with a good underwriting team, it can be a LOT of fun."", ""The one thing I would add is that, I think it can get quite political if you're at a small insurer.\n\nThere was one large account I worked on which made up about 10% of the annual GWP for a small insurer, and everyone had a view as to what the pricing should be. Portfolio, Underwriting and Finance would all have questions as to how the price was built up. \n\nAlso because it was a significant account, executive leadership would also put downwards pressure to get the deal across the line. Resulted in the premium being reduced a few times."", 'A large account is like a mini rate indication to determine the price/rates.

Then find a way to double or halve the premium if the broker asks you to.', 'Large accounts believe they deserve special treatment, often a discount usually because they have a large market share, and that they have better risks (or they’ll try to convince you so).

I'm just curious what the work entails (to me it seems mainly valuation based, but was wondering if there is a mix of pricing/valuation/advisory/etc. - also wondering if reinsurance transactions are a big part of the job as my current internship is at a big life reinsurer and I find it pretty interesting), how client interactions are, and what the pay/culture is like. I'm mainly curious about the EY/OW/Milliman practices in the NYC or Chicago Area. Thanks|['Currently lots and lots of focus on Bermuda reinsurance, blowing up like crazy. Very competitive bids, high work load, but also a lot of dynamic thinking if you like that. For someone fresh out of college, it can be a lot to digest unless you have an FSA exam under your belt or decent exposure to the nuances and main capital relief focus of most reinsurance deals migrating to Bermuda (you are more so “adjusting” your balance sheet to a better position because of favorable regulation, not necessarily creating explicit value through significant risk reduction or product/tech innovation).\n\n\nIf you want more specifics, feel free to DM.', 'Very fast paced and high stress, but lots of opportunity to learn a lot (from other consultants in particular) and very rapidly.\xa0\n\nFor sell side work, you could be working on the models underlying the liabilities (for various lines of business) and/or assets (at varying levels of complexity), or the deal model (Excel usually IME) that pulls together projections from actuarial software along with calculations for reinsurance (if not modeled directly) and capital (could be a mix of US and offshore depending on the structure of the business) and other assumptions. Fair bit of report writing, and responding to buyside due diligence questions, and running sensitivities with alternative assumptions. They are very wide encompassing projects with a lot of moving parts, and a lot of the times, you don’t know what the hell is going on, but usually you can collaborate with your team and figure things out (which is satisfying). Hours are usually very, very bad.\xa0\n\nFor buyside, I find it a lot less overwhelming. It’s kind of like trying to decipher what information you believe from an appraisal report and what assumptions you think need to be tweaked (either based on your client’s view or your client’s risk profile), asking questions (prioritizing said questions; often I find the actuarial questions get kind of deprioritized, but once in a while you’ll find a very significant item affecting value), reviewing additional information from the sellside, and adjusting the appraisal value from the buyside perspective. Sometimes the buyside client will want you to build your own models to validate the appraisal report projections.\xa0\n\n(For successful buyside bids, so if your client wins, can often translate to ongoing work as well, such as performing model conversions or doing routine work like cash flow testing).\xa0\n\nIn isolation, I do like that work, but when trying to juggle it with non-M&A work (or multiple transactions simultaneously) or if you have outside of work commitments (kids) it’s very difficult to remain sane over a long period of time. Transaction projects often command higher billable rates due to all the stress/high risk (I used to have a +$75/hr premium on my billing rate) which can translate to higher bonuses depending on your firm’s/team’s bonus formula. In my more recent years, I used to only accept M&A projects if it was a narrowly defined scope (e.g., setting or reviewing liability assumptions), so there’s definitely more sustainable ways to be involved in the work too.\xa0\n\nOne other aspect that I didn’t like was due to the time crunch nature of the work, a lot of the times, you have to make simplifications in the models or just flat out ignore things due to immateriality. For someone who is very detail oriented, it can be really unsatisfying to work on a model that you KNOW could be a lot better with a bit more time, but time and budget do not allow for it. So you may not be able to delve quite into as many elegant solutions or complex modeling as your little actuarial heart may desire. I always found modeling reserves to be very handy-wavey, for example. Or smaller lines of business might just carry forward projections from a previous appraisal and you really have no confidence in them at all (but they are comparatively small, so no one gives a shit).\xa0\n\nPersonally, I value my outside of work time more than an extra ~$50k per year, but I definitely would’ve been happier to do it when I was younger and single (post-exams), because of how much experience you can gain in such a short timeframe. I would caution against throwing your every waking hour doing M&A work when you are younger though, because your billable rate is naturally lower than when you are more experienced… so your blood/sweat/tears is kind of devalued in a way when you are analyst/associate level (IMO, compared to how critical your work is to the project overall. A bit of a bad deal looking back).\xa0\n\nA plus is that you tend to form pretty strong bonds with your colleagues, and get to know consultants from other firms/offices too (often working across the table from each other, so to speak), and there’s some kind of trauma bonding that inevitably forms. That’s… um.. something.\xa0\n\nAnyways, if that sounds good to you, GOD SPEED!\xa0', 'I’m curious, what is the best way to get into this practice? Can you make the transition from retirement easily or is starting in life preferred? Is this open to entry level?', 'Lot of bullshit lol but rewarding, learn a lot, decent pace , but when ur hardcore consulting, the pace is amplified, sometimes by 10 clients: pays alright made like 160k at one of those companies you listed, and wasn’t even a manager, but on a per hour basis it was basically minimal wage', 'Thank you so much for all the detail! Quick question: are the buy-side and sell-side teams always separate or do you get a mix of both types of projects?', 'For someone with retirement experience, I would suggest investigating roles in pension risk transfer (my understanding is that these roles are mainly at a few large insurers rather than consulting firms). You can get exposure to annuity products this way (which are often part of life M&A deals) and the cadence of the work should be pretty comparable to life M&A should you want to continue transitioning to that space.\xa0\n\nThere is entry level positions at many consulting firms, but you need to be prepared to juggle your exam study time needs vs client obligations. For the most part, I think entry level candidates who are very aggressively pursuing consulting careers are able to find the roles and manage their time appropriately. It’s more of a personality fit issue IMO.\xa0', 'Same. Would be interested to know the path to become an M&A actuary.', 'You get a mix; often it just depends on who has capacity to take on more work and who doesn’t have a conflict of interest. The big M&A shop on your list probably does mostly sell side though (just because they’re somewhat the gold standard and the budgets are much bigger for sell side).\xa0\n\nEdited to add: but even that big M&A shop will keep some people off a given sellside team just so they can be available to represent a buyside as well.', 'Thanks! When you say the “big M&A shop,” do you mean a specific one out of the ones I listed?

However, I keep seeing people say SRM was the easies exam for them so far and some people studied like 2 weeks for this exam. I feel really down on this fact. Is is really true that you guys feel SRM is the easies? Also, what level of EL should I aim to? I am currently doing level 3 problems for practices and planning to raise them every 2 weeks til i get level 6. Then Take practice exams for EL. Thank you|"['Give it time for the material to sink in. It’s easiest for actuary exams but it’s still not “easy” unless you have a stats background. \n\nUnderstand the concepts first and foremost. The questions should come super easy after that. Answering the end of chapters questions should help you more than doing quizzes to start.', 'I used CA and scored an 8. Left kinda unsure of how I did but was happy with my score. I secondly recommend reading ISLR multiple times. I changed that to my before bed reading the last few weeks. There’s also some guys that do these videos that go along with ISLR. I think it was in a previous SRM post. Those were also super helpful and I went through those quite a few times. They were free and just on YouTube. Lastly, actuarial nexus was just another source I used to obtain different problems. That’s also free. And flash cards. Lots and lots of flash cards. It may seem hard now, but you still have time. There’s a lot you can learn in a month.', 'I passed SRM in January with a 10 and here’s what I did: I went through learn on CA (only) in \\~ 10 days then started doing quizzes from level 2 for each section and up to 6. That’s for quantitative ones. Then for the qualitative ones I did quizzes up to level 10. Something I always do for exams is to review missed and marked questions in the last two weeks before the test and making sure I do them right + memorizing the formula sheet. In total I studied around 7 weeks with an average of 5 hrs/ day ( Wasn’t working). On the day of the test, I finished in one hour and reviewed for half an hour and got out.', 'I also found SRM to be hard. The major reason being it was not related to my undergraduate degree at all. I took two attempts to clear SRM🥲. Read ISLR ~4 times and every time it makes more sense and tells me that what you were thinking was completely wrong.', ""When I was studying for SRM, I found that there is so much more things to learn (relearn) compared to P and FM. I studied statistics in undergrad and my background did help in understanding the concepts faster. However, there is just so much things to remember, especially niche topics.  For me, studying SRM is harder compared to P and FM (and I was a stat major in college).   \n  \nI think that the conceptual nature of SRM makes it an easier exam (once you have a firm grasp of the concepts) compared to P and FM in the sense that there is no time crunch. SRM is the only exam (so far) where I was able to recheck all my answers and still have an hour left. Meanwhile, I was not able to recheck my answers in P and FM, and made more guesses.\n\nI used CA Adapt, and I had an EL of 6.0 and a Mastery Score of 70 when I took the exam. \n\nI recommend solidifying your foundations by answering CA's concept checkers. Reading ISLR will also help. I read the relevant sections at least twice if I remember correctly."", ""I personally found SRM much easier but it's not due to the learning process. The learning process definitely requires you to be more comprehensive and detail-oriented than FM and P, and there's a lot of qualitative information in addition to quantitative to learn. But what made the actual exam-taking easier in my opinion is that once you feel comfortable with the information, there's really no major curveballs or long-winded multiple step problems that can lead to computational errors. You also get a bunch of time. I finished in an hour and a half, and after checking everything 3 times, I left the exam an hour early and felt confident that I passed (which is very unusual for these exams).\n\nDon't get discouraged by the people saying they did it in 2 weeks, exams are not a competition and most people have lives outside of exams. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, and SRM is one of those exams where you likely know more than you feel like you do if you're consistent. At the end of the day, it's also multiple choice, so even topics you're unsure of you likely will at least be able to narrow it down."", 'it is easy because they study it in undergrad probably...it is easy if you discover that what you are taking in exam is something you studied hard before', 'how many questions did you set for each quiz?', '5 and did ~ 900 problems in total']"

Your bullet points are worded nicely, but in your experiences, you have a random space in between bullet points. After reading through, it seems as though you wanted to separate the teaching stuff with the business stuff, but try to make this clearer, or don\'t put the extra space at all. Same with the skills section, you have a random space where you separate the languages and technical skills. Either put them in separate sections, or have bullet points for each and don\'t put the space. Try to keep everything extremely consistent.

Overwhelmed|44|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jvuvf1/overwhelmed/|AmericanCheeseBurga|1744281886.0|13|1jvuvf1|0.93|"Hey everyone,

I’m about 6 weeks into my first full-time job out of college as a reserving actuarial analyst. But now that I’m actually in the role… I’m honestly struggling and starting to doubt whether this is the right path for me.

The biggest issue is the lack of training or onboarding. I didn’t really get a proper introduction to the tools or processes. Most of the time I’m either trying to figure things out myself or leaning on one team member who is also very busy himself. My project manager expects me to meet tight deadlines and when I miss them I get asked why it’s taking me so long.


I feel like I’m being held to the same standard as someone who’s been here a year already, and I’ve barely had time to get my footing. It’s making me question if I’m cut out for this job, or even this career. 

So I guess I am asking that is this normal for all entry level roles? Or did I just start at the wrong company/ this role is not a fit for me?


"|"[""Definitely role specific. It does not seem like your manager has any desire to train you and expected you to hit the ground running for an entry level role which is ridiculous.\n\nI'm a near FSA making an industry switch and even I get more leeway after 5 months in a new role than you seem to have.\n\nI would recommend letting your manager know that you need more training and that you're unable to meet the deadlines because you just don't know things. It's not crazy for you to say that because it's literally your first job. If you get any backlash or it ends up being more of the same, it would be time to look for a new role and/or stick it out for a few months so you can at least have something on your resume"", 'Wrong company! Nobody should expect a new hire to meet tight deadlines. The only deadlines you should expect to meet successfully without help is copying and pasting things, format edits, etc. Your work needs to be reviewed thoroughly and your manager or lead should pick up your inefficiencies to push forward and meet the deadline.', ""I only really had 5 deadlines when I started in reserving and that was to have my lines done by quarter and year end.So that's 4 quarters and one extra year-end thing for annual financial statements. So quarter ends had some work but other than that I was twiddling my thumbs and had more than enough study time the rest of the year.\n\nSince you'd been around for 6 weeks I guess you arrived in media res with a a quarter coming to an end plus some outstanding year-end things. Busiest time of year in reserving at a lot of places. The unreasonable thing though is expecting a new grad to get anything meaningful done for that quarter if they literally arrived at that time.\n\nThe next quarter sure, but this quarter presumably you were just getting acquainted with the requisite chapters in Friedland and learning basic terms like what ultimate losses are, what on-leveling and trending is, etc. And hey most of the people who take that exam have a  few years of experience, require 4 months of study and they still fail it anyway, so...a new grad not knowing jack shit isn't surprising to me so I don't think I really have to ask why they are taking so long to do something unless I knew they fully understood the task I assigned them and what it would take for them to get it done before I assigned it to them.\n\nSometimes a manager will replace a more experienced person with a less experienced person and then act all surprised when that less experienced person can't perform up to the level of the person they replaced. I don't know if that's the case for you but based on what you described, maybe it was."", 'I felt overwhelmed and behind the curve for at least the first year. Sometimes I’d miss a project deadline and get asked why it took longer than expected - and then my boss would help resolve the issues by teaching me the concepts or tools I was missing.\n\nIf your management is expecting to grow a plant with no water, that’s no bueno. But if you’re being challenged and mentored then this may be a great learning opportunity. \n\nAsk a ton of questions. Bug people for help if you need it. If it’s a good environment, they’ll respond and help. If you ask for help, get turned away, and then get blamed - that’s on them and it’s probably not a great place to work.', 'Yikes. \n\nIdeally your boss and an experienced analyst both set aside time to help you.  It takes a lot of time to onboard someone, especially someone new to the field.  You should have longer timelines, and a lot of review of your work. \n\nMy biggest advice is to ask your boss for any resources to help you on board. Ask for help prioritizing, and understanding deadlines before they are past.', 'Definitely not normal and sounds like more of a function of your company, not you', ""sounds like bad leadership. if an EL analyst is missing deadlines 6 weeks into their career, that's on the manager due to lack of training, support, communication, or common sense. \n\nif there's a silver lining here, it's that you can get a head start on learning how to figure things out on your own and having a list of questions to ask when you do get some time with a manager. that's a skill that i think some folks learn too slowly, but even then, it's way too soon to have to do that."", 'This goes hand in hand with the common fallacy of people who know things: knowing and leading/educating are **completely different endeavors**, and when a person knows a lot about a subject, they almost automatically default to underestimating how *little* other people know about that subject. (Kind of like a reverse Dunning-Krueger effect, or something...) Then they bring that underestimation into their professional/leadership activities, and their direct reports seem to be ""dumb"" or ""not working hard enough"" or ""not taking things seriously,"" etc. Which is of course egregiously wrongheaded. \n\nOn your end, it\'s nerve wracking at least 2 different ways: (1) everything is technically complicated and confusing and deadlines aren\'t being met, and (2) the *social* dynamic of being a new person in an existing team, wanting to be good at the work as soon as possible with minimal disturbance of others, and stressing about what leadership might be thinking about your performance. \n\nSo to echo what some others are saying, the best way through this is to speak up and ask for clarification. If things get testy (they did with my leader, which was a 3rd nerve-wracking thing), then be sure to document the questions (when, where, who, what, etc.) as much as possible so you can demonstrate if necessary that you\'re giving a good faith effort to improve. In my case, it took longer than I want to admit for me to be confident enough to speak up (and ""not worry"" about bothering people), and before too long, leadership actually realized that clearer guidance was necessary. Things have improved significantly on my end, and marginally for the whole department. Even small improvements make everything much more manageable, feeling more like regular *work*, and less like constantly fearing for your job or wondering if you\'ve chosen the right profession.', 'While it’s definitely their responsibility to get you up to speed and help when you need it, you can help the situation a lot by advocating for yourself. If you don’t ask questions and don’t communicate that you can’t meet a deadline, people will just assume that you understand what you’re doing and will have it on time. And then when you end up not delivering, it makes it that much worse than if you said up front “I don’t understand this and this will take me a while.” It’s not ideal but some people are too busy to actively check in on you and make sure you’re progressing through the work. \n\nIt’s normal to not understand the work when you’re six weeks in, but the real question is what you’re going to do about it. Even if they gave you the best training course in the world, it’s still completely different when you’re actually doing the work and situations come up that didn’t come up in the training, or it’s just something you forgot. My point is that it’s a little premature to throw up your hands and give up just because they didn’t give you the best initial training, since no matter what you’ll still feel lost and have no idea what you’re doing. So what actually matters is having the skills to navigate in an environment where you know nothing and know to lean on your resources. Try to really get a sense of what you’re working on, and come up with specific questions that people can answer. Ask if there’s any documentation for the processes. Take a lot of notes for yourself. If you try all that and it’s still an unsupportive environment, then that’s the time to consider a move. I’m not saying it’s all your fault and truthfully it shouldn’t be this difficult, but the reality is a lot of companies are overworked/understaffed and investing in better onboarding and training is never going to be the highest priority when there’s other work to be done, when they think analysts are going to leave after a year or two, when a lot of the job is learn as you go anyway, etc.', 'Happened to me my first job, and trust me it’s not you it’s the current team.( manager) switch teams of companies', 'This is not normal at all. Is there something going on that is causing everyone to be too busy, like failing an audit and having to fix a bunch of things, or is this considered the usual workload for your position?\n\nEither way, I would probably look for a new position. If your manager is really trying to help but is busy due to extenuating circumstances (like mentioned above), then maybe try to stick it out… but only if you think your manager will be able to devote time after whatever issue has been resolved. Otherwise, job hunt', ""Is this in the states or in a developing market? Asking because I'm from Sri Lanka and my first job here in a life insurance actuarial department last year was quite similar - very little guidance given and we were expected to figure a lot of things out which was ridiculous really. One of the people that was supposed to be guiding me and another new hire through a process would expect us to understand everything immediately and would ridicule us when we asked questions. Thankfully I'm at a P&C firm now (intentionally moved, much more interesting than life!) with a manager and team that is very supportive, but I do know that what I experienced is also somewhat common in the market here - hence my question.""]"

Given that it's 34 MC questions in 3.5 hours, you need to make sure you're thoroughly ready on both sections.  This includes understanding the concepts, and drilling down as many questions as possible.\n\n\\- Try to understand the intuition and patterns of questions that frequently pop up (e.g. loss triangles).\n\n\\- Make sure you can recognize distributions for different types of questions, so that you can figure out what to calculate and how to solve."", 'I did two quizzes a day and tried to pair them up by content (big long term section with small short term section).

I currently have 7 years of work-ex, 3.5 years with a direct life insurer in India, 3.5 years with international consulting firm (Singapore, Hong Kong). 

I am planning to pursue an MS (Data Science/Analytics) in the USA, this fall 2025 in NYC and then explore full time actuarial roles with Life/Health/InsurTech companies. I have a strong pricing, modelling and reserving experience.

I am inclined towards the USA mainly because of the growth prospects, work life balance and lucrative pay scale. Given the current job market, would it be extremely difficult for me to find a job after graduation (Dec 2026). I understand companies are apprehensive to sponsor international actuaries and that H1-B chances are also becoming increasingly slim.

I thoroughly enjoy my work, the balance a 40 hour work week + studying gives (less stress than consulting/most fields that offer salaries 100k+).

Right now I’m 25 making about 100k, will be 110 with ASA, probably 140-150 with FSA. My wife also makes about 90k.

Right now, if you look at houses in a great school district in my state (not CA/NY etc), a 2000 sq foot nice house goes anywhere from 500-600k. From my little research, it seems a large % of the housing market is owned by black rock etc. and they don’t plan on selling (renting etc). Do you see these houses eventually dropping in price? The only reason I could see this happening is if there is a major recession with very high unemployment - I could be wrong.

 What is your current/projected plan for buying a house? I enjoy my apartment but I can’t imagine I’d want to rent forever. I also invest a lot as I’d like to retire by the time I am 50ish.

"|"['I do not have a crystal ball but I can tell you on 200k-300k household income you should VERY comfortably be able to afford a mortgage on a 500k-600k home, just make sure you put 20% down.\n\nIt is NOT necessarily a better deal than renting but there are other reasons than pure economics to purchase a home.\n\nI am one of the cucks that bought a house at the top of this insane real estate market. It fit my budget. In the back of my mind there is a voice that reminds me I could have gotten so much more if I was 10/15 years older and bought a house sooner.  But, It is what it is and this is the economy we live in. I tell that voice to fuck off.\n\nFind what works in your budget and if you want to be a home owner, go for it. Best of luck.', ""Housing is expensive due to policies that make it difficult to build new houses. That's the main factor. The main policy change that would make it easier for young people to afford a home would be to ease zoning restrictions to increase density and build more housing.\n\nIt's difficult to see that happen since the main resistance comes from regular homeowners who are scared that allowing high-density housing will, rightly or wrongly, decrease their property values.\n\nAnyway, with the numbers you listed you'll be okay. By the time you and your spouse are in your mid 30s I would guess your household income would be somewhere between 300k-500k assuming your careers are somewhat similar in trajectory. That's more than enough to afford a mortgage, but then again who knows what prices are going to be like by then. I guess the scary thing is, if you're like me you might have grown up in a house the same size, built in the same year, that cost less than a third of what it does today - and those houses today might not even have ever been renovated."", 'The thing about BlackRock is overblown. Your real competition when buying a home are wealthy 50+ year olds and retirees. I say that as someone who just bought a house like you are describing ($540K house 2000 sq ft in a HCOL suburb with great school district). If you want to buy a single-story home in a quiet suburb there are a ton of retirees with cash on hand that will beat you to it. \n\nIMO houses will not decrease in value in the near-term, and if you want to buy a house then do it when you want it. Don’t try to time the market. My parents lost money on their house because they bought it at the peak of the 2007 bubble and sold it in 2019 right before prices shot up but outside of that scenario if you are living there 10+ years you’ll probably be ahead. I probably overpaid for my house and have a shitty interest rate but I can afford it and now I don’t have to postpone having kids anymore because I no longer live in a tiny apartment in a bad school district, so I’m very happy with my decision even if houses lose value the next few years', ""The idea that a large % of housing is owned by Blackrock is outside the realm of reality. Whether in NY or CA or not, if you want an affordable home, you can move to a place that has cheaper housing, or buy those houses, which your family makes enough to afford. Housing is never going to go back to being as cheap as it was before the pandemic barring crazy unemployment and economic disaster, which is possible but for most housing will no longer be their focus. \n\nYou just have to do what makes the most economic sense for you based on your risk profile, just like any form of investing. If you plan to have kids, buying makes sense still in most cases, if you don't plan to have kids, I think renting makes the most sense. I personally don't plan to buy a house until I can pay mostly cash for it. If you can rent at 30% of what a mortgage payment would cost for a house on your area, save the rest, put down a massive downpayment when you’re ready. You’ll be fine.\n\nFor context my annual rent + utilities is less than 10% of my gross salary. I have a multi-bedroom apartment (one is used as my home office), safe and friendly neighborhood, laminate flooring, granite counters, garage parking, no noisy neighbors, and have public transportation for my city within walking distance, though also drive regularly and have a car.\n\nJust reiterating if you think Balckrock owns all the homes in your area and you’ll never be able to buy, then just move."", 'Trying to ""time"" any market in the short term is no better than a guess, whether stock market or housing market.  \n\nThe only way I would expect prices to come down would be if rates went and stayed well over 7%.  If rates do end up below 6% I could see prices going even higher or at the very least, you likely have more competition for homes.\n\nWe bought back in 2021 and some friends said we were dumb to buy when it was ""high"". we have a rate under 4% and our house is worth roughly 30% more now than when we bought it.  I would recommend figuring out what you both want/need in a house, look at lots of houses and don\'t buy just to buy, but if you find a house you can see being at for a while go for it. For me, life is too short to live somewhere I don\'t want to be just because I am trying to time a market', 'My hope is that blackrock keeps overpaying for houses. Finds out no one can afford the rent anymore and has to sell it at a loss.\n\nSince that is wishful thinking especially in a place like nyc, my other plan is to hope for congress to step in and prevent private corpo4ate ownership of resendential property at the scale blackrock does it.\n\nSince that will only happen when hell freezes over, ill just rent until my offer for some town house / apartment gets accepted', 'I had a similar household income (just over 200k) when my husband and I bought our house just about 2 years ago. It’s definitely not a house we will be in forever, it’s just not big enough, but it’s enough space for us now and gave us the opportunity to build equity. Although my mortgage is higher than the rent we were paying at the time, that rent had been going up pretty steadily year after year, and our quality of life has improved so much not having to share walls with noisy neighbors. It was absolutely the right choice for us. Down the line once we feel we need more space we should have built up enough equity to make our “forever home” more in reach financially.', ""Similar to what others are saying, you may want to scale down your budget for your first house. In all likelihood it won't be the first and last house you buy, so it doesn't have to be perfect. For example if you don't already have kids, do you really need the house to be a in a great school district just yet?\n\nFor reference, my wife and I bought our first house at 28 for 315k (combined income was just above 200k at the time). A few years later we moved to a different city and bought a house there for around 550k.\n\nGood luck!"", 'Purely from a demographics perspective, I see housing prices either dropping or at least lagging inflation as baby boomers begin dying at higher rates and our low birth rate as a nation fails to replace their massive numbers. I know immigration will offset that to some degree, but I just fail to see housing demand increasing over the next 30 years at the same rate it has over the last 30 years.\n\nI’m a 35 year old homeowner and would recommend not rushing into it. I have a handful of friends who FOMOed into buying a house and regret it because they bought more than they needed, or didn’t consider the likelihood of wanting to move in the near term. The median age of a first time homebuyer is now 38, and even before the recent spike it was in the low 30s. Nothing wrong with not being a homeowner at 25, and I’d argue it’s better to give yourself time to build up a big emergency fund because homeownership comes with a lot of big expenses.\n\nMy wife and I bought when we were 32 and 30 between having our first and second kids, and I feel like that was the perfect timing for us since our family was growing and we wanted some stability. I don’t regret renting in my 20s since I moved a lot and didn’t need as much space as I do now.', 'My opinion is to wait. 1. mortgage delinquencies are highest since 2008. 2. blackrock is dumping in various areas so maybe homes havent been that good of an investment. 3.

Renting is way cheaper for us (for now), and everything here is like 500k+ for what we really want, even though we're decently far from our local downtown.  However, we are able to save 3k/month towards a down payment without really trying, so after bonus thats like 50k/year depending on how the company does.

Many of our friends who decided on where to live 6-8 years before we did bought at better prices and interest rates than we could. That said, as late as we bought our first place (just a couple years ago at age 36-37), our house appreciated even further (and rates got even worse).

So, you're probably right in your analysis about the root cause of the problem.\n\nEDIT: Just found out the 85 million doesn't include single-family attached homes, but the rental number does.

You can do that while remote too, it just takes more intentional effort.\n\nWhen you're remote, you're just less visible, which makes it easier to forget you when opportunities come up or so you're not necessarily top of mind when it comes to annual raises. Your analysts might be less willing to go the extra mile for you because they don't know you as well. So that's the kind of thing you just need to offset if you're looking for a higher trajectory."", 'IME, if you go from in-person to remote at the same firm, not really. I went fully remote in 2017, even had two kids between then and now (taking 6 months and then 12 months off), and always felt like I was given the same opportunities as anyone in the office in my team. Granted, I was with my team for almost 8 years before going remote, so I think it would be more difficult to do this remote from the get go.\xa0\n\nIMO, most opportunities in consulting are ones you need to make an effort to make yourself though. For instance, I moved to the SF Bay Area (from the NYC area), and spent a couple years testing the waters with the insurtech crowd in Silicon Valley on my own initiative. (It didn’t pan out; only had one RFP and the startup didn’t respond 😂 too expensive I think, and ultimately I decided to stop working / early retirement), but I never felt limited by being remote (just by my own ambitions).\xa0\n\nMaybe it would be impossible to become top level partner at a big consulting firm while being remote, but then again maybe not. It really depends on how ambitious you are and whether your firm recognizes value in what you’re trying to do.\xa0', 'Probably yes and no….yes you miss out on the networking/team-building with coworkers and potential face to face with clients….but you technically can put in more hours which consulting values. \n\nGuess it would depend on the company/team.', ""It depends, I think early out of college yes because you just don't know who to talk to do it's easier to forge organic connections in person. This of course depends on if your teams are in the office. \n\nLater in your career 4+ years I don't think it matters. Consulting has a high travel % so I'm full-time remote but end up colocating at client sites enough that I see my team regularly in person."", 'I think this depends in part on the culture of the firm. If there is a large in person presence then being remote is definitely a bit harder since there aren’t the natural relationships, but that doesn’t mean you can’t grow. Personally, I think that means that you need to work harder to build these relationships. I set up monthly meetings with 3 key people in my company to continue to build relationships and get mentorship’s, l connect with others when the opportunity arises, and I travel to offices to connect in person as it makes sense. As such I have been able to develop relationships throughout the company, but it takes a lot more mindfulness than if I was in person on a regular basis.']"

My manager at the time promised—twice—that she was working on my promotion. When the time came, she got promoted herself and didn’t even say a word. No update, no acknowledgment—just silence. After that, I completely checked out. I focused on my exams and did the bare minimum until I could get out.

Eventually, she rotated out and a new manager came in—someone she was close with. I often saw them chatting in Chinese at the office, which honestly made me feel excluded. It felt like the new manager was overly critical of everything I did, and I couldn’t help but wonder if they’d been talking behind my back. That was the final straw—I decided to leave.

A few weeks later, I had multiple job offers and went with the most prestigious company. And wow—what a difference. The culture is respectful, supportive, and people actually appreciate my work. It’s only been a few weeks, but I already feel happier, valued, and way more motivated. So glad I left that toxic environment.

You didn’t burn out, you didn’t lash out—you pivoted. Focused on your exams, held your boundaries, and moved on with intention. That’s power.\n\nThe fact that your new role is already night-and-day better just proves the point: toxic managers don’t get to define your worth—and when you stop tolerating crumbs, better opportunities find you. This is a reminder to everyone in the profession: you’re not stuck.

Career advice please?|3|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jqjd55/career_advice_please/|csystem123|1743689206.0|2|1jqjd55|1.0|"Hi, I am an actuary with almost 10 years experience. Need some career advice. Here's my career so far.

Year 1 to Year 3 (non-life insurer): pricing retail business (personal lines and motor) + some portfolio monitoring for commercial business such as workmen compensation and property.

Year 4 to Year 7 (composite insurer): switched company from a pure non-life to a composite insurer. But I still specialise in non-life, albeit now in reserving and regulatory reporting.

Year 7 to Year 10 (still the same composite insurer): Job scope changed to reinsurance management for entire non-life segment for the company + starting a commercial lines pricing function (which didn't exist before and was fully underwriter-driven) + Motor portfolio

3 promotions in 6 years with the composite insurer (so in hindsight a worthwhile career switch). Qualified + company pretty much handed the reins of almost the entire non-life segment to me. Retail pricing excluded only because I had little interest after doing it from Year 1 to Year 3.

From an individual contributor to a manager handling 3 (going to 4) headcount in this same composite insurer. My credibility to my senior management is sound (evident from the many times my name is quoted for non-life issues to investigate).

Now my issues are
1. The composite insurer is a big player in the local market but has literally no regional exposure.

2. The composite insurer is incredibly ""petty"". E.g. no budget for any seminars or training out of the local country, even if my reinsurers are willing to co-pay together for me.

3. The business is looking more and more ""vanilla"" to me. I appreciate and recognise the progress I had, but I am losing the passion, even more so with point #2 above.

4. Doesn't help when the non-life business owners in the company are (much) older and doesn't have the same drive to push for results. Or for some reason, are ok with having loss-making products.

5. Chief Actuary is Life-trained and cannot appreciate non-Life business and have unrealistic margins for non-Life. (Who plans for 25% profit for a new product?!)

Looking for career advice because I saw a regional/global pricing role and for some reason, it intrigued me greatly even though it was a sole contributor role with much lesser exposure to senior management. Am I just being ""sour"" and demanding too much from my current company? I would reckon many would want my current position? "|"[""Careers do not go in one smooth line upwards and are usually jaggy up and down. I'm nearly 20 years now and have found it much more fun and lucrative to just do fun things. But your mileage may vary and it really depends a lot on your life circumstances and personality.\n\nActuaries tend to be a conservative lot after all, and there's nothing wrong with that either."", 'I’d say you’re letting your restlessness and ambition blind you to the fact that you’ve got a hell of a good gig right now. You’re complaining about a lack of “regional exposure,” but not everyone needs or wants that globe-trotting, conference-hopping lifestyle. Sure, it’s fun to name-drop big markets, but if your actual job and your team are thriving locally, maybe that’s enough. Let’s not pretend that traveling to a fancy seminar on the other side of the world is always better for your career than staying put and deepening your influence at home.\n\nAnd you’re already in a powerful position. You’ve got the trust of senior management—when does that happen so quickly anywhere else? If they think of you first for non-life issues, that means your opinions actually matter. A “sole contributor role” in some far-flung region might sound exciting, but you’d be a small fish in a gigantic pond, away from the eyes that can promote you. Here you’re shaping the entire non-life segment, even if you find it a bit “vanilla” right now. Sometimes “vanilla” is code for stable and profitable, and you might regret leaving behind the credibility and support you’ve built over years just because you’re restless.\n\nAlso, let’s be realistic about your complaints regarding the chief actuary. It’s easy to say they “don’t get” non-life, but maybe you don’t get their perspective on margins. Maybe they have a bigger picture in mind that you’re not seeing. And the older business owners who “don’t have the same drive” might just be more seasoned, more measured, and less eager to chase short-term wins. It’s one thing to dream big, but it’s another to run a business where risk appetites differ.\n\nYou say you’re bored, but it sounds more like you’re impatient and maybe a little too sure you’re ready for a bigger stage. You’ve done well, but 10 years isn’t an eternity. If there’s a silver lining to the pettiness you’re dealing with, it’s that you’re learning how to maneuver within constraints—and guess what: big multinationals aren’t immune to ridiculous bureaucracies either. You might land in a regional role, get starry-eyed at first, then discover they’ve got a thousand new petty rules that make your current issues look quaint. The grass always seems greener, but it’s often just grass with a different set of problems. Maybe the frustration you feel is just the natural restlessness that hits after a series of promotions. Sticking it out could pay off in bigger ways than you imagine.']"

Actuarial University Enrollment in Canada: Is this field becoming oversaturated?|37|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jq6az4/actuarial_university_enrollment_in_canada_is_this/|Neat-Requirement-710|1743645346.0|36|1jq6az4|0.93|"Has anyone attending the actuarial programs at Waterloo, U of T, UQAM, or other schools in Eastern Canada noticed a spike in enrollment over the last couple years?

I went to SFU myself, and the cohorts I saw were relatively small, typically under 20 students each year. However, after speaking with some current first- and second-year students, they mentioned that their cohorts have recently grown to around 40 students.

This, along with the record ASNA attendance numbers — 600 students in 2023, growing to over 900 in 2025 — makes me think that schools like Waterloo may be seeing an even bigger increase in enrollment. If that's the case, we may see the entry-level job market become increasingly oversaturated in the coming years.

Can anyone attending these schools right now confirm or refute my suspicion? Have enrollments in these programs increased significantly?

That being said, the enrollment numbers in the ActSci program here have been steady declining over the past decade: I believe it’s less than half of what it was in 2016 (600 -> 250 ish). \n\nRegarding the job market, I do see some stiff competition this year across internship/EL levels. It definitely seemed easier to obtain actuarial internships and EL jobs from 2021-2023 than in late 2024 and early 2025. I think a part of this can just be attributed to economic conditions leading to hiring slowdowns/freezes, so there’s just less jobs available even if actuarial enrollment has gone down sharply post-COVID.

The lingo was different, priorities weren’t the same, and the available resources varied significantly. Transitioning to a different environment meant I had to relearn a lot, not because I lacked knowledge, but because the context had changed. \n\nThat said, as long as you have a supportive team, good mentors, and the motivation to keep learning, this feeling will naturally fade over time. It’s also a sign of humility, which is a valuable trait.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer (Chartered Engineer in the UK) and a Python simulation specialist. 

Married to an actuary hence my interest in the field (along with my tangential role as a modeller in heavy industry engineering).

About 6 months ago I made an Udemy course on Python aimed at engineers and scientists. Since then over 7000 people have enrolled in the course and the reviews have averaged 4.5/5, which I'm really pleased with.

I know there are a few actuaries out there interested in learning the foundations of Python - especially in the new age of GenAI where it's really helpful to have a basic grasp so you can review and verify generated code.

The course is quick - split into 10 bite sized chunks. Only takes a few hours.

If you would like to take the course, I've just generated 1000 free vouchers: [https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-engineers-scientists-and-analysts/?couponCode=APRIL2025FREEBIE](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-engineers-scientists-and-analysts/?couponCode=APRIL2025FREEBIE) 

If you find it useful, I'd be grateful if you could leave me a review on Udemy! Also if you are interested in simulation then I have a little bit of information about my simulation offerings at the end of the Python course.

And if you have any really scathing feedback I'd be grateful for a DM so I can try to fix it quickly and quietly!

I’m an international candidate (with FSA from SEA) looking at actuarial master’s programs:

"|"['Temple has a very extensive networking program and I don’t know of many people who went there (undergrad or graduate), applied themselves and took every opportunity available, and then did not get a job post graduation.

Best of luck!', 'Whichever school gives u the highest scholarship amount and is cheaper', 'I’ve known people who have attended all 3 schools (albeit undergrad), and they’ve all thought their school was the best. They all have very strong actuarial programs with great support for getting internships and jobs. I would recommend the school that you’ve gotten the best vibe from - campus, people, etc. Also consider internship opportunities - look for insurance companies in the nearest cities for each school, and think about how you would commute there (car/train) and what would be the best fit for you.', 'St John’s is great! I’m sure the other two are but being in Manhattan was the best! \n\nThe staff is super nice and knowledgeable and work with you to help with internships and full time offers. Being so close to so many offices also helps because companies often donate to SRM and have a vested interest in the students. The network is huge. Before it was bought by St. John’s, it was the college of insurance and most older professionals (at least those I’ve met) have either studied or took an exam there. Basically anytime I interview for something, it’s a good conversation piece since they are connected to it.\n\nSt John’s has a lot of international students, I wasn’t one of them so I don’t know details, so im sure they help with visas. My friend was an international undergraduate and he got that STEM visa thing.\n\nThe course work is great. They have an international insurance course in which they pay for you to go to different countries and meet different professionals there. I know you said you are FSA but they now have classes where if you get a certain grade, you are given credit for the exam.', 'I did my Bachelors at Georgia State 6 years ago, the school did absolutely nothing to prep for exams. Granted, there’s been new leadership and the Master’s program may be different, but I feel like Coaching Actuaries is a good substitute if you just want to focus on passing exams.', ""What do you want out of an actuarial master's program as an FSA? \n\nI'm gonna make a leaping assumption: Are you primarily looking for US student visa time + US job opportunities? If so, I would go with whomever is cheapest. I would expect all programs to provide visa support, although I'm not the most well-versed in visas. All those schools are in nice metro areas. Temple/St John's might have a slight-edge [given they're in the Northeast](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2023/may/me152011.png). Also consider getting looking at Data Science, Finance, or Quant masters as well. That would pair better than an actuarial masters given you're already qualified.\n\nYou're more than qualified enough to apply for jobs today. My advice is to apply for jobs while you're also applying for your masters. Actuarial masters degrees are not a significant asset in the US job market, and you'll still need sponsorship from companies anyways whether you have a US masters or not."", 'They\'re all best at having connections to jobs in their respective local areas.

For example, the NY/NJ/CT area has a lot of St. John\'s alumni and experience hiring their grads, while most people there are just less familiar with Georgia State.  So if you plan to apply to a lot of Northeast jobs, St. John\'s is a good bet.\n\nTheir programs are going to be more or less similar.  If you have your FSA already, you aren\'t going to benefit from the education you\'re going to benefit from being able to say ""I am a student at a US school so eligible for internships and also I have a visa.""', ""St John's also have really generous scholarships for grad students!

Should I have one row per policyID or should I have more than one row? For example, if a policy had an MTA (mid-term adjustment), should I summarize everything in one row or should I treat the before and after MTA as two separate rows?

Would be great if you could provide specific material about that as well"|"['Man I always get scared of answering these questions just in case my advice is dumb and somebody out there is smarter than me.\n\nIf mid-term adjustments are rare you can discard the observations and justify that decision based on the immateriality of the issue (plz let this be true so I have less work to do). If you think about your data set as being a statistical sample, that\'s okay if it\'s big as it would still be significant.\n\nI thought about some schemes as to how to split the policy. Splitting the policyholder variables across two rows and allocating the exposure across them is easy enough. The problem arises on how to allocate loss amounts. I don\'t like this idea because if a loss occurred prior to the MTA, and if it gets assigned to the first row, all of the loss would be divided by a smaller exposure which would result in an unrealistically high pure premium. I guess, one can argue that if it\'s the kind of claim that also would have been covered after the MTA you could argue to just keep the policy on one row with the old variables. But then if a claim happened after the MTA and it would have only been covered after the MTA you have a worse problem imo because...okay I\'m rambling here.\n\nYour observations need to be ""homogeneously-defined thingies"" and the MTA makes your dataset consist of non-homogenously-defined thingies so my preferred solution would be to just get rid of those observations with an MTA and make your model with what remains. If this is a pricing model, if an MTA occurs in real life, then the policyholder\'s premium gets adjusted pro-rata based on how long they have left in their policy. Trying to work with adjusting the observations brings in too many problems IMO especially if I have other things to do.

Learning processes is crucial at every step of the way. If you don’t understand the low-level, mundane calculations, it will be hard to put the big picture together.\n\n3. Bachelors in really anything, but actuarial science, statistics, math, finance, and economics are the most popular. If a school that is feasible for you has an actuarial program, I’d recommend that. If not, I’d recommend statistics and maybe a minor in finance.\n\n4. Eagerness to learn! The exam process will be miserable if you don’t actually like studying and learning! Not to mention that if the nature of understanding data/financials don’t interest you, you will hate the job. Even though I myself am going into the career for the stability like I stated, the other options I were considering were quant finance, stats consulting, or mech engineer. What I am to say is that if you don’t want to learn the math, it will be hard to go into a math field. I knew I wanted to “look at numbers all day”… even though to me, it is much more exciting than that sounds. The people aspect is also huge, especially in consulting work.\n\n5. In my last semester of college, going into retirement consulting. Past internship at life insurer. I am also my university’s actuarial tutor (1 of 2) and I help people plan out their exam tracks/classes/resumes just about everyday, so I’d love to help you (assuming you’re in the US… I don’t know about the career abroad).\n\n6. From my internship experience and length interview process, the worst part is working with people that cannot communicate what they want. Managers tend to either micromanage to the point where you are so detached from your own work, or be so hands-off that the expectations/goals aren’t even clear. Best part is the flip side of the coin, sharing results and collaborating with people who also want to add value/insight.\n\n7. The profession is growing and that is intentional. There are still plenty of actuarial jobs, though. Insurers, reinsurers, consultants, and regulators are the most common employers. Some banks and large corporations also have them, though. \n\n8. Kind of answered above— actuary, actuarial consultant. Lots pivot to data analyst or financial analyst if they hate the exams, though.\n\n9. Wherever makes ur heart happiest\n\n10. Comparison is the thief of joy. Everybody’s actuarial journey, and more importantly life journey, are all different\n\nMy perspective might be different than others given that I’m on the younger side, but I am probably a great resource for figuring out a good plan to set yourself up for the career during college.', '1. No idea what I wanted to do in life after high school, was good at math. Parents pointed out this career and it pays really well so I figured why not.\n\n2. Entry level actuarial position, usually called ""actuarial analyst"". Career progression is mostly based on years of employment and progression through your country/region\'s professional actuarial body of choice. As far I know they are all pretty much exam based, so it comes down to how many exams you\'ve passed.\n\n3. At least in North America, you only need a bachelor\'s degree (I\'ve had coworkers where it wasn\'t even actuarial science degrees, just anything math/economics related). Usually though you\'d want to also already have a few exams from the professional society passed by the time you graduate.\n\n4. Good at math and with computers for skills, critical thinking is probably the most important from qualities. You need to understand why you\'re using the data you use and how it should actually be used, you can\'t just rest on what people have done before (at least not in my experience).\n\n5. These days my work is largely reviewing other people\'s work, training, and coordinating what will be done next, when, getting the support we need from other teams, etc. Most of this is excel based checks, meetings, emails, etc. At a more entry level position, my experience was more so being given a project and then starting by collecting data in excel, from our company\'s data sources, from other teams, etc. Then once I\'ve got the data I need, I convert it to assumptions that go into our models (fancy calculator software that shows what the life of our policies will be, the resulting profit, etc.), running the models with the new assumptions, and then preparing summaries of the results for my manager. Unfortunately I kind of suck with this question but hopefully that\'s a little helpful.', 'Thank you very much', ""6. Most would be that I find the work interesting and the pay is good. Least would be that there's a constant pressure to work outside the designated 9-5. I know a lot of actuaries who do have to do that, and I'm lucky to be at a company that mostly respects the boundaries, but even then sometimes I have to stay late just to make sure deadlines are met and like I said, there's a constant pressure to make myself available at later hours in case I'm needed (for now I've managed to maintain being very firm that when I sign off I'm gone, but I'm not sure I can keep it like this forever, especially if I want to advance my career any more).\n\n7. The main companies that hire actuaries are usually insurance and reinsurance companies. You can also get government jobs and some pension roles outside of traditional insurers, but those are far fewer. The market these days I think it's pretty bad. More extreme weather and economic uncertainty is definitely hitting insurance companies across the board, and regulation, which I am generally in favour of, does admittedly make it hard for a lot of companies to react appropriately (just look at the number of insurance companies pulling out of states in the US). I think we'll probably pick back up in a few years if the global economy recovers at least, but I somewhat worry that we might also be at risk from a lot of the technological advancements that are encroaching on other careers.\n\n8. This is a difficult question to answer, just because it's a bit vague, sorry. There is a very wide variety of actuarial roles. Typically speaking for example, you can have pricing actuaries, who deal with development of new products and improving existing ones, versus valuation actuaries, who mainly deal with calculating reserves and managing all of the in-force policies of the company. Even then, a pricing actuary for a life insurance company will be different from a pricing actuary in a health insurance company. Even within a life insurance company, pricing actuaries can work on wildly different products and become specialized in those. Then you could branch out to actuaries who mainly deal with investments, consultant actuaries, etc. I would argue most of these jobs are fundamentally similar in a lot of ways, but they're also different in very critical aspects that make it hard for someone who specializes in pricing structured settlements to just jump into doing valuation on UL.\n\n9. N/A for me\n\n10. I'll list 2 if you don't mind. First was imposter syndrome. As much as I love my work, there's an absurd amount of stuff I don't know. When I started? Even less and by a lot. And when you're working and surrounded by people who seem to know what they're doing, it's hard to feel like you belong. It took a very long time for me to feel like I had enough of a grasp on my work to claim I was knowledgeable, and even then sometimes it still creeps back up because there's just so much more to learn. The second is balancing work with my personal life. This is mainly because I'm including writing those professional exams as part of work. Studying for these exams is usually a months-long affair, and by the time you've written one, it's almost time to start studying for the next one. Throw that studying on top of the 9-5 (or potentially longer hours like I said earlier), and good luck finding time for your friends and hobbies. I'm lucky that one of my main hobbies is gaming, which I can do easily even with fairly little time, but even now I'm getting sick of these exams and want to move on to do other things with my life."", '\n1. I came across this career in high school, and was drawn to it for the ability to use math, description of the job as high paying and low stress, and the meritocracy of the exam process. I liked that it was very clear what you had to do to become an actuary.\n\n\n2. After college, you’d start as an actuarial analyst. Different companies call this role different things, but it has the same basic responsibilities: prepping, updating models, assisting with building final exhibits, and studying. Almost every reputable company in the US will have a study program (I am unsure of other countries) where you get about an hour a day to study for your next exam. After a few years and your Associate credential (either ASA OR ACAS), you’ll move up to Associate Actuary. The work is a continuation of what you were doing before, but you’ll have more freedom of approach to design the models and might supervise and review work from a new analyst.\n\n\n3. Almost every company requires a Bachelor’s degree. Most actuaries bs e degrees in math, actuarial science, or statistics. There is no advanced degree required, but there is a credentialing process you will do while also working. This will take several years. If you go to BeAnActuary, they’ll have more info about the exams and different societies, and if you go to ActuarialLookup, they’ll have info about the average length of time to complete the exams. Personally, it took me about 10 years to be fully credentialed.\n\n\n4. Attention to detail and quality are important! So is being inquisitive and creative. Obviously, math and analytical skills are required because that’s basically the whole job. For soft skills, being a good communicator can get you really far, especially as you progress in your career. You’ll often have to take a massive dataset, get an answer, and then explain a technical concept to someone who doesn’t spend much or any time with numbers. Learning to craft the correct message for your audience will get you very far. \n\nThis career wouldn’t be ideal for someone who dislikes analytical thinking or computer programming. We aren’t programmers, but we do spend a good portion of our day implementing and reviewing logic on various software programs.\n\n\n5. I’m mid-career, with 12 years of experience and my FSA. I’m an individual contributor (not a manager), and I’m working with a new dataset we purchased that’s getting used for various initiatives across the company. It’s my job to understand and explain this data, and help people in other departments understand exactly what they’re getting when I send them results, as well as creating specific views of the data and estimating savings for the different initiatives. It’s a fairly non-traditional role for an actuary. \nI usually spend about 2-3 hours a day in meetings with stakeholders across the company, another 3-4 hours working on the things I just talked about, and the remainder of my day doing things that aren’t specific to my role, like participating in departmental committees or checking in with coworkers.\n\n\n6. I like the work/life balance. I get to do really interesting work for 40 hours a week and then turn my brain off and focus on my family. I also like that the work I’m doing is very impactful across the company. My coworkers across both my jobs have been brilliant, creatives and amazing to work with.\n\nI dislike the amount of meetings I go to (which is an atypical amount for an actuary, especially when you’re entry level). I had a few weeks recently where I was in meetings for like 5+ hours a day, so it was hard to get anything else done, and I don’t have the attention span for that many meetings. Also, sometimes the work can get a little boring in certain areas of the company, if you’re working on something that recurs monthly or annually, or where the final product is super prescriptive (populating rate filing exhibits, for example).\n\n\n7. Actuaries are primarily employed by insurers or consulting companies. I don’t know specifically how the job market is for entry level, but at fully credentialed level, it is very easy to find a job. EL will be harder, but if you have exams, technical skills, and an internship in actuarial or a related field, you will have an awesome shot. (I see a lot of complaining on Reddit, but that has always been around, even when I was looking for an EL job, so I think some of that might be posting bias. People landing jobs are less likely to make posts about it.) Actuaries are also more layoff proof than a lot of other fields, because we are necessary to meet some regulatory requirements and build and maintain the products. The company cannot run without actuaries.\n\n\n8. Actuaries usually work in health insurance, life insurance, property and casualty insurance, or pensions. You will start your career in an actuarial department or consulting, but it’s common to find actuaries in company leadership.\n\n\n9. I’ve only worked in the same region my whole life, so I can’t speak to which physical location is best. I started my career in consulting and switched to insurance a few years ago. Both have their pros and cons. Consulting is more fast paced, and you’ll get exposure to a ton of different types of work, but also a lot more stressful. Insurance is very chill, but doesn’t have as much as an upwards trajectory as consulting and the work can move very slowly because you’re with a project from the day it’s dreamed up all the way through getting various approvals and implementing the results. \n\n\n10. It was tough the balance the exam process with having a life. I did all my exams while I was in consulting, so I was working a ton, getting minimal study time at work, and having to go home and study for hundreds of hours. It’s tough to do in your twenties because you want to enjoy freedom and your paycheck while you’re still young. Part of the reason it took me 10 years to get my FSA was because I took time off between exam sittings to actually enjoy life with my friends and family. But, I would still have periods of time where I’d basically fall off the face of the planet, neglect everyone, and cancel all plans for weeks at a time. It’s tough to find a balance of when to do that and when to take time off.', 'thank you so much this is super helpful and insightful']"

From the result, we can see that in PC2, the coefficients for Reading SAT and Math SAT are negative, while the coefficient for Writing SAT is positive.
Why does the answer say:
PC2 shows that the residual variance not explained by PC1 can be mostly explained by the Reading SAT and the Math SAT being positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with the Writing SAT. This is because Reading SAT and Math SAT both have positive coefficients, but Writing SAT has a negative coefficient.

I calculated the earned exposure as : 200+200\*0.5=300, only include the AY2000 AY2001. can someone explained the answer from CAS please. Thanks a lot !! "|"['drew you a picture: https://imgur.com/a/lb9fYUZ\n\nBecause the ""density"" is 200 exposures/year everywhere, you\'ll get the same answer for any area in the diagram equal to 1.5 years.

So for 1999 policies, half of the earned exposure will come in 2000. Similarly, for policies written in 2000, the experience period will include 100% of the earned exposure for the first half of 2000 (so, 200*.5 =100) because those policies expire before the end of the period. But for the second half of the year, we only get 75% of the exposure because only half of 2001 is included. (Think symmetrically: we get 100% of earned exposure for policies written by July 1, 2000, but only 50% for those written by Dec 31, 2000, so the average for the period is 75%. So for the 100 policies written in that half of the year, we count 75 exposures. And then for 2001, we get only 50% of the exposure for policies written on Jan 1, and 0% of those written after June 30, so we get 25% of the exposure for the 100 policies written in that half of the year.', 'What is the question to this problem?', 'It is area assigned to each year accordingly.

Actuary vs Modern World|32|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jnzuzl/actuary_vs_modern_world/|saroshhhhh|1743416179.0|25|1jnzuzl|0.71|"Hello Fellow actuaries.
I am in my late 30s I have around 8 years of experience of life and general of reserving in different insurance companies. So i know my work pretty well.
I have passed 3 exams and after that i just left the exams 
But now after so many years one person convinced me to start again for cas but i am stuck on one thought.

When i see the world . The world is advancing so much in so many things for example quantum computing , AI, cyber, different types of engineering structures, too much development in medical sciences, underwater tunnels between countries but when i see actuaries . They study so complex things for so many years just because they can earn good money , otherwise for the last 8 years I havent actuaries doing any extra ordinary job . Just calculating reserves and pricing. Which is just not justifiable with their profession .
I dont feel any motivation to give so much time to exams just because to get a raise in salary .
I have a family so i have a limited time  so i want to give my time to something that is very valuable , something that actually matters .
What do you think guys?

"|"[""There is a lot in this post, some of it is a bit hard to follow, but at a glance, I'm not really sure what you're expecting with this field? If you want to go into engineering or medical research then by all means go for it, assuming you can reasonably deal with going back to school to study a different subject. \n\nActuarial, and more broadly insurance, is not going to be a space where you really see and contribute to innovation the way you might in STEM or similar fields. Our job at a very high level is just to make sure that insurance companies remain solvent through holding adequate reserves and pricing changes. The work, while not glamorous, is a bit technical and needs to be done, so we are just filling that role. \n\nI may not be the best person to speak on this. I have doubts as to whether or not I'll stay in the field long term too. A lot of it really boils down to the question, what do you want out of your career and life? Are you content doing work that isn't intrinsically rewarding but has good pay and hopefully not crazy hours while  trying to pursue purpose elsewhere outside of your work or do you need to have your work scratch that itch too? It really depends on the person.\n."", 'If you have better things to do than take exams, you definitely should not take them', 'Probably because quantum computing isn\'t managing hundreds of billions of dollars. Even your best HFT or algo trading isn\'t managing hundreds of billions of dollars. When there\'s that much money on the line, you want to be as conservative as possible tbh. \n\nAlso if we\'re talking about life /annuities, the primary business (at the end of the day) is providing a guarantee of some sort. If you\'re going to be pricing a guarantee, its better to go with a ""tried and tested"" method over some new breakthrough AI thing. Imagine telling your CEO you mispriced a product 10 years ago by using some AI black box model and you dont know how to unfuck the product. \n\nThe comparison I\'ve always thought off is off roading. When you go hard-core offroading, its far better to have an old and tested V8 or v6 over some new hybrid / EV simply due to reliability (putting torque and other numbers aside). Its why people buy the pre2024 4runners. They\'re reliable, easy to maintain and just run. \n\nSimilarly, you don\'t need super complicated stuff for a ton of stuff we do. I think there\'s advancements being made in stochastic analysis, dynamic assumptions etc. But again gotta really make sure they work unless you wanna be on the hook for billions in claims payout', 'You absolutely are taking exams just for money and if anyone doesn’t believe that when starting out then they need to re-think their priorities. \n\nI have been and know other people without credentials that have fellows who report to them in the hierarchy of a company and know non actuaries smarter than people who passed exams. Exams don’t make you extremely intelligent because you took them, and barely help you do your job any better. They are solely a barrier to entry and way for employers to assume you aren’t a complete idiot in one facet of intelligence. \n\nIn terms of enjoyment, you won’t change the world working for an insurance company. It’s a competitive business. Mayyyybe you can put a good idea out there as a consultant, but uptick will be difficult unless you’re driving policy on the Hill in the US.\n\nThat being said if you are business minded person, you certainly can make a difference on company performance and earnings. You aren’t powerless to drive change, it’s just business positive change, not saving lives or changing society levels of impact.', 'Actuarial has generally pivoted to more of the business side. The core work of pricing, reserving, and product management still needs to be done. If you don’t like it, then change.\n\n\nWith billions of dollars on line, insurance companies tend to be conservative with a “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” mentality.\n\n\nI’d argue that actuarial has evolved quite a bit and slowly broadened its horizons (just maybe not as much as you hoped it would). At the end of the day, actuaries are on the business side of the fence. \n\n\nUsing more modern data science techniques or shoving new leet code down everyone’s throats would likely be very costly, cause employee dissatisfaction, and result in a lot of stress. With that in mind, the results and business decisions would be very unlikely to change as a result of the modernization efforts. So rather than waste millions and stress out the employees, many companies are taking a slow and steady approach to modernize.\n\nI’ve been involved in quite a few modernization efforts where the new leadership may push whatever new method or Silicon Valley trend. The ones trying to be trendy usually end in failure as they don’t tell the company anything they didn’t already know. Sure, results may be slightly more accurate or have a better visualization, but the pros are outweighed by new models being more difficult for the average employee to use/explain and costlier to maintain given additional expertise needed.', 'If you haven’t ever looked at them, I’d say skim some of the source material for at least 5 (and maybe 7-9). At one point they helped me fill in some missing pieces of why templates/processes were working how they were. \n\nAlso, the job is going to be what you make it. If you keep using the same templates just how they are of course there won’t be advancements. But plenty of what we do can be converted to other tools that do more of the steps for us, and that is an advancement. And obviously the “source papers” we all base our methodology on came from somewhere—keep asking questions about why things are done a certain way and see where it leads. I remember several exploratory presentations about how modeling/machine learning techniques could be used in reserving.', 'What you see as mundane, perfunctory work IS valuable. Not everyone in society can be an innovator, just like a society of all entrepreneurs or all landlords couldn’t function (because they’d have no one to hire to do their business’ work for them, or no one to rent houses to.)\n\nThe work that actuaries do creates the necessary conditions for there to be a stable platform for innovation. Just like no innovator, no matter how brilliant, could do any of their work without construction workers, truck drivers, grocery/food service/food prep workers, etc.\n\nAll the innovators we lionize would be living miserable subsistence farming lives if “boring” jobs didn’t exist.', ""You can always use your actuarial background to price risk in a company, or start up, working in quantum computers. Or AI. Or Cyber. Or rocket ships. Or space mining. Look to the edges and service a new product niche.\n\nNo one becomes wealthy on professional alone. It's a good floor.\n\nIf you've an itch for more risk and frontiers can spin up your own practices. Or partner with other smaller ventures to service those new spaces. Can always pin up a new company or service. Good floor and technical background for it. Actuarial is more of the rock stars of math. Can act like it. Actuarial doesn't have to behave like accounting."", 'I understand your feeling. I worked in reserve field for many years and was caught on CAS 6 for many years. I stopped taking CAS exam for 10 years due to kids and family. Instead of continuing on CAS exam, I finished masters degree of data science. I think it is my best decision. Even I passed CAS exam 6 and got my ACAS, I switched to data scientist and am working in AI related field right now. What I try to say is there are other choices other than actuarial field, but it needs to continue study and pave the path to the direction.', 'Someone once told me early in my career that if your sole motivator for writing actuarial exams is to make more money then you will be miserable. While it is a huge motivator (it can even be the biggest) it can’t be the only one. If you don’t find any of the exam material even remotely interesting and it doesn’t help you be better at your job, you should really look at other career paths. I think every exam I studied for was interesting in some way or another, and even if the skills weren’t transferable to my day to day, it gave me a better appreciation for my profession.\n\nWill actuaries solve world hunger or colonize mars? No but we are essential to the financial stability of a system without which you can’t do the sexy things you mentioned in your post. The insurance industry may not be the big headline maker but without it, there would be serious limitations on innovation because of lack of financial safety nets companies that are actively trying to innovate can enjoy.', ""I've also struggled somewhat with what you're mentioning OP. I think actuaries can expand outside insurance, but then are the exams worth anything outside of traditional actuarial roles? Maybe some qualified actuaries can move into non-actuarial roles and get paid equal or more than an 'Actuary' role but it probably takes some effort by the individual. The SOA/CAS could sell our skills more, imo.\n\nI would follow what you're passionate about. Looking back, I probably would not have taken exams had I known how difficult it would be (just to find the time to study). Life happens.\n\nMaybe try pivoting to something within actuarial that's more interesting to you. Research roles may scratch that 'doing something that matters.' Or something more tech-y, then transfer that knowledge to work for a company or cause that's important to you. You could even do this now, using your past experience and selling that in an interview; saying hey I want to do something I find more meaningful."", ""Lots of incoherent rambling and quite a bit to unpack here IMO... \n\nI guess, firstly, there is a fairly small subset of jobs/roles which fit the bill for people who became interested in this career, namely its being good at math (not the most cutting edge but solid / well based math), minimal/high but optional coding, reasonably sensible 9-5 (for the most part), a bit more business-y than being a pure math career (e.g. academia or certain one-off math jobs), fairly corporate for the most part (which comes with the pros and cons of being corporate including progression up the corporate ladder), decent/better pay than other non-specialised jobs in corporate but not the top tier pay.  \n\nSo, if the above all rings true for you then congrats i think you're more or less in the right career path, with optional variations to suit your taste but still broadly 'an actuary'. However, if not, then there are many other great careers which I think you should maybe explore to see if its a better fit for you, and again theres no wrong or right answer here but that being said you have to be willing to go through the tougher process of most likely getting a 'lower' role while breaking into a new industry.\n\nSo now, if you have decided that this is the career path for you, and the question is whether to finish your exams or not, then its a matter of what are the exams worth to you. For most, the general answer is a c.20%-30% higher salary, and (arguably) better career progression with more opportunities open to you. However, if say 30k / year is not worth the 5 years of study time and effort and time away from your child, then yes absolutely you dont have to do it; and conversely if you are still progressing in your career (and not having a fellowship isn't a hindrance) then absolutely dont have to do this at all. \n\nI get the sense that you feel a bit stuck (which is not uncommon), but unfortunately getting unstuck will take time and planning (ie. you need to angle you career trajectory to get to where you want to go), which we are speaking of in the quantum of upwards of 2-3 years to say c. 5 years, assuming a 'normal' repositioning process vs quitting your job and starting a business type route. So what I think is best to do is thinking about this '5 year plan', where you want to be, and working backwards from there to see which course of actions will best support your goals?"", 'I am not interested in space or engineering. I am sorry i am confused myself thats why i am asking here . I love statistics, actuarial sciences and love to play with huge data but i dont understand why actuaries only limit to very small part of insurance and not to the other growing industries. In the last 100 every field changed significantly but i dont think thats the case in actuarial sciences', ""> Actuarial, and more broadly insurance, is not going to be a space where you really see and contribute to innovation the way you might in STEM or similar fields\n\nI understand what you're saying... insurance isn't sexy. But to say that actuaries don't see or contribute to innovation is just not true. There is plenty of innovation happening in insurance, particularly in P&C. Predictive models, telematics, new software, and new forms of insurance such as cyber. There are plenty of exciting opportunities in the industry. If you want them go find them."", 'Quantum computing is also a literal marketing scam that has no practical use cases ATM', 'I think OP understands that the motivation for the exams is mainly just the money but moreso is struggling to find that alone to be motivating, which I totally get.', ""The people who do pricing and reserving and not the other things you listed do it because they enjoy it or find it interesting and aren't interested in those other fields. You think differently, so maybe you can go pursue them yourself.\n\nNot everyone likes the same things and plenty of mundane jobs do a lot of good work for society - janitors, sewage workers, garbage men...the work isn't sexy but their jobs are essential for public health and cleanliness and they are proud of the work they do.\n\nNow for insurance, if these policies didn't get priced and reserved we would have never entered the age of exploration, we wouldn't have flown into space and we would have never performed life-saving surgeries like heart transplants. Our work as risk management professionals serves as the bedrock for those industries to exist."", ""You could try to pivot into data science. It's not that actuaries couldn't do other types of work with statistics and data analysis but at that point it's not actuarial anymore. This is kind of a bad analogy, sorry I can't come up with a better one at the moment, but it'd be like asking why don't police officers branch out of law enforcement and go into other industries like private security - they absolutely could with their experience/training but they wouldn't be police officers then. Actuaries are linked to insurance by definition.\n\nIn regards to the field not changing (I feel like I could argue it has but I may also agree with you depending what kinds of changes you mean), would you be willing to elaborate? What kind of changes would you like to see in the field or would you have expected?\n\nEdit: I want to offer a caveat to what I mentioned regarding actuaries strictly working on insurance. Im in P&C consulting, and we also do stuff like estimating liabilities for things like warranties or rewards programs for certain clients. Neither is technically insurance but they behave similarly."", 'I agree with what you\'re saying. When I was responding to OP it was more in regards to the types of innovation I believe he was referring to which are (or are said to be) things which will have wide societal impact which is why I had added the "" in stem and similar fields"". Telematics or cyber insurance aren\'t really impactful on that same scale.\n\nHaving said that, some of the stuff he was referring to I also believe are largely over-hyped (AI - somewhat useful for certain tasks but it\'s a glorified chatbot taking steroids, quantum computing - had an opportunity once to speak with researchers on it by way of a mutual friend + get a tour - it\'s not happening anytime soon and is mostly just a lot of trying to get VC money. Underwater tunnels between countries -??? Idk but I know some guys in NYC who would love that)', 'I think you misunderstand the intent of my post, and maybe OPs. Not every response is directly to OP. It’s more my own commentary on the topic being presented for people reading the thread. \n\nThough you could also argue if OP understands their situation they wouldn’t be coming to Reddit to post about it. There are 1,000 things I could do to make more money in my life but only do them if I am invested in the long term ROI. You come to Reddit to post about it because you’re unsure if the ROI is worth it. Thus soliciting feedback. There is no advice needed if you have no motivation to do something that only benefits you. You just don’t do it. \n\nLike I have no motivation to make a pizza from scratch when I can just order one. It would never cross my mind to post a big thing on Reddit about it unless I was questioning the cost / benefit analysis in my head or wanted confirmation that my thoughts of it being worthless were shared and I wasn’t missing something. My post addresses those things for OP and provides additional opinion for others in the topic.', ""Not OP, but I would argue most of my coworkers didn't become actuaries because they love insurance or reserving or pricing. A lot of their reasons seem to mostly boil down to being good at math in school and wanting a well paying, stable job without too much additional schooling which would allow them to feel financially secure enough to support their hobbies or families. In fact I feel like most didnt really even have a good concept of what reserving or pricing really entails until their first internship or job, since a lot of university courses really boil down to exam prep and the preliminary exams, while important, don't really teach you much about the work itself.\n\nI absolutely agree that insurance is fundamentally very important in allowing modern society to be where it is today but it's hard to tie any sense of reward or satisfaction related to that to the work we do day-to-day, it is far more disconnected and abstract where we don't directly see the impact of our work."", '>reasons seem to mostly boil down to being good at math in school and wanting a well paying, stable job without too much additional schooling which would allow them to feel financially secure enough to support their hobbies or families.

This perfectly encapsulates the motivation of 90% of actuaries.', ""I've thought about this, but most companies I have been at have been pretty friendly with exposing their actuaries to hyped up subjects such as data science, programming, and these days gen-AI.\n\nNow what I see is that several actuaries might take a course or seminar on Python and R, and then shortly give up and return to traditional pricing and reserving. Or they'll learn just enough to do a special project or paper. The ones who really are interested keep going and then eventually do those things for a living. \n\nMy conclusion from this is that the traditional actuaries really do prefer pricing and reserving over high-tech subjects. Maybe there's something deep down inside that they'd prefer to do over traditional work, but it sure isn't programming."", 'Current college student, this is precisely why I am pursuing the career lmao', ""I'd agree with that, I know a few that were looking at becoming math teachers, but decided against teaching due to low pay among other things.

It's sorta convenient in the case where you lost connection or accidently close the page. Then when you come back to the discussion you haven't lost anything. But for me it seems painfully slow. Curious if anyone else is having the same experience?

I like geographic flexibility - other professions are large enough in size that they have work options in every city.

Either the lower wage prediction comes true and employers have the bargaining power, or AI doesn't have the juice and we get back into a more investment-friendly environment and employees gain the upper hand again.

With underwriting i was confused because the. Production for the policy is 3 years so when i tie the claim with the production i take the date when the policy  was issued even if we have renewal every August for example.. Claim date 1st Nov 2023 but the policy starts 15 March 2022 to 15 march 2025 in the underwriting year is 2022 or the the renewal 2023 ? I'm really confused.. Anyone can advise please |"['Really hard to say without seeing what you are doing exactly. How many years did you do? A single UWY was higher than the corresponding AY? Those wouldn\'t be directly comparable and I\'d question whether you did it correctly. For example the 2024 UWY should be really low unless something in the product causes a ""seasonality"" early in the 3year period or just the year starting off bad.\n\nSo, with Accident year, you need to earn the premium and appropriately assign to each accident year. Then the claims simply fall by accident date. If doing over many years you will have premium from several underwriting years.\n\nWith Underwriter year,  again earn the premium and then put both the premiums and loss to the original underwriting year. The tricky part here, is older UWYs have WP=EP, but the most recent years should still be earning in thus WP<EP. Unlike above,  all the policies are from the same UWY, now you just have claims from multiple AYs.\n\nYou only said P&L, so I\'ve assumed you aren\'t adding any development or other adjustments. You\'d want to remind anyone looking at it, particularly for longer tail lines, the most recent years are missing a lot of development.', 'The issue was the production was low and the claims were very high that contributed to the high loss ratio. The issue whether i consider the UWY the year the policy was issued or the year where the claim occurs?', 'UWY is the year the policy is issued.', 'Sorry i mean if the renewal was before the occurrence date should i use the UWY of the renewal or the year it was issued?', ""Are they 3 year policies or is it renewed annually, just in force for 3 years? I think that's where the confusion is coming.\n\nSounds like you are talking the latter, in that case you use the renewal date, assuming your company reunderwrites the policy every year.\n\nWe had a product once where we guaranteed two renewals as long as no claims, so we treated those as 3 year policies unless they had a claim and had to be reunderwritten."", ""Yes they do underwrite every year but for the new production only any old production stays the same rates. Yes exactly I'm very confused."", ""Yea, well you should be talking to your manager or whomever requested the information and work this out with them. As it sounds like you have a very niche product.\n\nIf the product only gets underwritten when New and rate doesn't change on them, I'd probably go by original underwriting year. Since that best reflects what is happening. Although you might even want to break each of those down by AY, just to demonstrate how those policies are changing over time.\n\nIf you have the time and not being pressured with deadline, I'd probably just take several approaches with adequate labeling to demonstrate your different thoughts on the performance.

So long story short, recently our manager went on a maternity leave and she is replaced by Head of Risk. The guy doesn't really know the technical side of work (unlike previous manager) and is being really insecure (I feel). This is because he will try to be relevant in team meetings by being more of a project manager than a technical manager.

He also has very bossy way of communicating on group teams chat. (back and forth frustrating questions, asking about things that he should already know as a manager etc).

So actuaries, what should I do?"|"[""Given the temporary nature of the situation, I would just...tolerate him until your boss gets back.\n\nIf you like working for your manager they are doing a good job, shielding you from upper management's upper management-isms.

I graduated from a Canadian university with a bachelors degree just under 2 years ago and went straight into consulting at a medium-sized firm in Canada. Ever since starting at my current company, I've felt unsupported in my career development and I'm worried that this may have left me at a disadvantage.

It's no surprise that dropping the average limit from 10M to 1M (to generalize) would produce a phantom negative severity trend that's not actually applicable to future business. Likewise, moving the average deductible up from 2.5K to 10K is going to visually tank frequency trends.

If every policy had the same line sizes, these shifts wouldn't be an issue. We have a very reliable set of size of loss curves, and could easily adjust the historical data to an ""as-if"" level matching current sizes. The problem I'm facing is that I can only tackle this is aggregate with average censors and limits. I can use the distributions to adjust for an average deductible shifting from 2.5K to 10K, but there's an underlying spread of actual deductibles. For example, we would reliably be eliminating a large proportion of claims by moving to that 10K deductible, but in reality we may have half the book at $0 deductibles and the other half at $20K. To give a more extreme example, we could shift from 100% of the book at 10K to half and half on $0 and $20K, and the SoL analysis would say that we should see no change in loss activity as a result, which is clearly incorrect.

Any insight or literature on handling this mix shift, specifically for average line size, would be appreciated.   
"|"['Use your $0 deductible claims and restate them as is they had a $10k deductible. You can do similarly on restating data to the current limit.

Then recreate your book, accounting for the known mix shift, and adjust the by-layer trend assumptions until the simulated aggregate experience is close to the actual. Test out different underlying trend assumptions that achieve this. Then, use what limited data you have to support which underlying trend pick is most plausible. Communicate results with caveats. \n\nAlso, try to find a benchmark or competitor data, a little can go a long way in giving a reasonable assumption of the pattern in trend by size.', ""I can restate to nested layers, but the problem is that some of the policies in the current book are still $0. There's a range of deductibles, but it's only meaningful to look at frequency and severity at an aggregated set above policy level, so I'm working with average deductibles and limits. These averages are changing, but there's still a range in the underlying policy terms, which is what is confounding the trend."", ""This is an interesting idea, and I think it's got some legs.

I pushed hard to improve those methods (splines, GAMs, moving from residual to frequency/severity), and the company results reflected those improvements. The company was bought out and I ended up in a non-pricing role, so I am now looking for a new opportunity.

Here’s the challenge: nearly all modeling interviews are with folks from ML-heavy or tech backgrounds. They often dismiss my experience because it’s not built around machine learning. Many seem unfamiliar with the regulatory and operational realities of P&C pricing which makes the conversations frustrating. I usually get offers, but I leave interviews feeling like I don’t belong.

"How to become a good communicator on the ""fly""? Any advice from experienced actuaries? I'm getting burnout from preparation in order to communicate ""well"""|66|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jj7uea/how_to_become_a_good_communicator_on_the_fly_any/|-LostActuary-|1742865823.0|29|1jj7uea|0.98|"I hope my question makes sense. Is this skill even feasible for most of us mortals? Can you develop good communications skills on the fly?

For example, if I want to communicate something complex or a do a formal presentation, I have to prepare a lot before hand in order to be effective at communicating it. I'm not talking about memorizing what I want to say word for word, but brainstorming and thinking of different ways of getting what I want to say across until I'm comfortable enough. However, it gets exhausting doing this over and over again.

Is it feasible to develop a skill where you can just communicate and explain things well and effectively on the fly with minimal to no preparation or is that just fantasy. Is there a specific way of achieving this? "|"['[deleted]', 'I think knowing your audience is the best advice I could give. \n\nWhen I have to present something, I usually start with writing down the conclusions I think this audience needs to know. Then, I work backwards from there into the supporting details, again being mindful of who I’m talking to. If it’s a technical audience, I can get into some of the weeds without being worried about getting lost in the details. If it’s a non-technical audience, I just hit the highlights and let their questions guide the rest of the conversation - if they take it more technical, then so be it, and hopefully I’m familiar enough with the project to answer their questions.', ""I think it's fantasy. I heard some advice that you should have some discussion points prepared if the CEO were to suddenly appear at your desk and ask what you were doing. You don't prepare for literally every scenario, just what is most likely.\n\nSo if that were to happen, it may seem like you can think on the fly, but you really aren't.\n\nOkay I'm just kidding, that's being idealistic. Once you move up high enough you just promise the client anything no matter how unrealistic it is and then bully your subordinates into delivering on it. Then when they inevitably can't you say what you can to turn that poop into wine."", ""I'm in a similar boat of trying to get better. It's a little hard to make the pivot from the technical depth you need to consider important as an actuary, to the surface level story that ultimately matters to an executive.\n\nMy current approach usually goes one of two directions, depending on what's easiest at the time:\n\n1. Start too detailed while explaining it to myself out loud just to get it out. Recognize what's not really important and cut it, organize points into a better flow to the story, and make it high level.\n\n2. Get out the high level story I'm trying to tell, then figure out which additional details or context are absolutely necessary to include and add those second.\n\nThen it's a little easier to talk off the cuff when you're really just trying to hit a few main ideas."", ""Just talk to the smartest person in the room(who isn't yourself). The others will pretend they know what you are talking about."", 'TLDR; …. TBD \n\nDo you have this same issue / concern when talking with a friend about a non-work item? \n\nIf so, then no you probably will not be able to quickly learn how to improve this without a ton of practice and though I’ve never done it, I do love the idea of improv. \n\nIf you don’t feel this way when with friends, then I’d address two major barriers. First, do you understand the topic well. If not, learn more so you feel confident in your knowledge, and be comfortable just saying “I don’t know” when you don’t. Second, and maybe most important major barrier is to realize everyone around you is just another human like you, no matter their title. \n\nI don’t really prep for anything, short of a presentation to a large client where misspeaking can have a serious financial impact, or a recorded presentation to hundreds of people where I feel like there is a larger possibility for embarrassment if it goes poorly and where timing is very strict. Outside of these two areas, I just kind of approach everything as a conversation. It’s really easy to show up and just talk about something when you feel like you’re in a room of peers and have conviction in what you are saying. \n\nThere is likely one topic you can think of in your personal life where a friend asks you a question and you just immediately answer with detail and don’t think long and hard before responding. That is how you need to get about work. \n\nAnother huge step into doing this well is knowing your audience. So not communicating with the same detail to everyone. For executives, think again about the personal topic you don’t think about when talking to a friend. Now imagine a cashier asks you about the same topic, you still aren’t thinking much before responding but you’re probably not waxing on about it for 20 minutes, your brain quickly adapts to a few concise sentences that communicate a point and move on. If you ever hear someone ramble, think of how you could have said the same thing in a couple sentences, even if you don’t have to speak. You’ll get more used to it. A key part of this is LEAD WITH THE POINT. Don’t give background first 95% of the time. Say “$100 is our current projection” If someone cares to know why they’ll say, “how did we get there?” Don’t start by explaining all the work you did and end with “…. So our current projection is $100” and if someone asks a question, answer it immediately, don’t qualify it first or tell a story. If you ever hear an exec repeat a question in the middle of a response lol you’ll know what I mean.\n\nLast, this is an incredibly important skill to learn if you don’t have it. As you move up, you will not have Time to prep for meetings and presentations. You’ll be forced to answer questions on the fly, jump in to present because your boss got pulled into something else at the last minute, you’ll be jumping from meeting to meeting with no time to practice something before going to the next one on something completely different, etc. I can’t tell you how many meetings I go to now where I don’t even know what it’s about beforehand, minus reading the title as I join it lol… this includes meetings I am leading or scheduled myself. Every meeting / presentation / conversation is to gather info, disseminate info, and/or build relationships. Doesn’t sound too daunting when you think of it that way in my opinion. \n\nDid you think of how I could have said all this in 2 sentences?', 'The fantasy can be real if you’re that sort of presenter yrself. My presentation style is very much on the go, going word by word on the script never works out well for me. I can do q&a on the spot with minimal effort. But def for a professional & important one, I usually have the big ideas and understanding in mind and frame the sentences with the big ideas in my head for impact before actually presenting it. I don’t see a presentation as a presentation as a talking session per se, I see it as an act/performance. Knowing yr strengths and weaknesses as a presenter is key to save yr energy and time on it while also capturing yr audience’s attention. Since creativity might not be yr strength, I’ll suggest not to push for it. People can tell if you’re not well prepared or just drawing statements here and there. If you’re good with the nitty gritty details and content, go for the scientific approach presentation style. Present yrself as yrself.', 'Assuming you know your topic, not giving a fuck will help immensely.', ""Honestly, I think you're doing what you're asking for already.  Seek out the opportunities to do the preparation you speak of and your abundance of experience will do the speaking for you eventually.  This is pretty much the exact case where nothing trumps experience.  The best way to get better at something is to do that thing.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to be wrong, it's the best way to learn.  And ask questions, no one gets upset because you asked a question even though in the back of your mind you might think it's stupid.  It's an overused saying that's actually true but someone else in the room probably has the same question and everyone ultimately benefits."", 'This is a bit of a different take but here are my thoughts... \n\nSounds like you are looking for (1) comfort and (2) confidence vs. actually having more technical answers ready at hand.  As for the discomfort, you may be suffering not so much because of the actual feeling but more so because you have this idea that you shouldn\'t be feeling it. It\'s not supposed to be easy! That\'s what they are paying you the big bucks for and that is probably what drew you to this profession in the first place. You love a good challenge and you know deep down that pushing past your comfort zone is the only way to fulfill your potential. As for confidence, you know it literally means ""with trust."" Not that everything is going to work out, but that you have what it takes to handle whatever life throws at you. Preparation helps, but consider looking for some other ways to intentionally foster your confidence.\n\nAs for the actual preparation, sometimes it\'s less about the volume of preparation and more about the type of preparation.  Yes, technical preparation is important, but are you neglecting other equally important ways of preparing yourself to show up as your best, most awesomely confident and effective self? I\'m talking about physiological preparation (getting enough sleep, not eating crap, getting your butt out of your desk chair) and psychological preparation (breathing deeply, reminding yourself of all your prior wins, striking a power pose, etc.)  Consider reallocating some of your preparation time to these activities. After all, all kinds of elite performers will tell you that it\'s 90% mental. If that\'s the case we should be focusing more effort on our mental game. \n\nLastly, have some self compassion! What you are experiencing is part of the common human experience.  Be mindful and kind to yourself.  Have hope and patience - it will get easier.  Also the very fact that you are worried about being a good communicator means that you are already a good communicator. What is your evidence that you are not? Could it be that\'s not even true? Consider that you might already have this skill that you are dreaming of, you just need to let it shine through. You got this!!', 'Toastmasters has a section where you practice speaking on the fly. So you can better at improvising.\xa0\n\nBut you need to recognize that preparation is super important for good communication.\xa0', ""Practice helps but I think it is as genetic as being very handsome/beautiful. I'm a fantastic extemporaneous speaker...but have always been (not paired with good looks unfortunately) 20 years ago I did acting and all of it was easy. \n\nI NEVER have to prepare for presentations, meetings or anything beyond just being familiar with the subject matter.\n\nI happened to have won that random genetic combination and then developed it from there.\n\nYou can improve, but to be truly great at it, I think there is a base level of genetic lottery involved."", 'My guideline has always been ELI5.  My goal with preparation isn’t to be better at explaining a thing, but to make the thing simpler in my mind, and then it will be easier to adapt the explanation as needed on the fly and I can spend the presentation or meeting paying attention to the audience, and not myself and the thing I’m explaining.\n\nBut ELI5 is also my guideline for actually feeling comfortable doing my work in the first place, so I’m doing that prep every damn day all day.  That’s the actual part of my job that is tiring, because until a thing looks simple to me, I’m completely freaked out that I will obviously screw up the analysis, which is a concern long before I have to present the material.  For me, the scary/hard part happens when I’m working alone, not when I’m meeting with others (see username).', 'Communication is a skill that is developed over time with practice. I found it easier to present and talk about something I am a subject matter expert in. \n\nI use rules of thumbs, frameworks and systems for my business communication but some principles apply generally. \n\nHere are some examples. \nOnly two things matter in communication\n\n1. Audience \n\n2. Message\n\nAudience can be technical, non-technical, executive, and even yourself. An additional rule of thumb I follow is: I treat everyone as if they’re an executive which means\n\n1. I value and respect their time\n\n2.  Summarize summarize summarize, executive summary, summary after each section, conclusion summary. Use bullet points but no more than 5 or 10 (refer to the fingers on your hands to count). \n\n3. High level until it’s necessary to dive deeper. \n\nOn messaging, I use what I call the core-care-do framework that I learned from a previous director. \n\n1. What is the CORE message?\n2. Why should anyone CARE?\n3. What should we DO about it, what’s your recommendation?\n\nFew things are worse than someone bringing problems without any proposed solutions even if the proposal is completely wrong. Who likes that? Also even if the solution is obvious to someone else like a director, it tests your own knowledge and understanding. Think 7th grade science project where you state your hypothesis then do testing.', 'I think a good way to develop this skill is to mentor/train interns or entry level. When you do it focus on the “why?” of your different tasks. Don’t just focus on the mechanics of getting it done. It will start coming naturally the more you do this and the different learning styles you come across.', 'The short answer is no. Given our profession it’s very rare for someone to be both a technical expert and an effective communicator. With that said though, communication is a skill, and it can be learned. Like others in this thread have offered advice, here’s what’s worked for me with 8+ years of experience: 1) READ. Read everything and anything you can. Reading will absolutely help you become a better communicator. 2) WRITE. Write your main talking points. This will help you develop your thoughts into words more efficiently. 3) PRACTICE. Start with yourself and making sure you understand the material. If you don’t understand it, neither will your audience. Once you have that down, practice with your most technical people and then work your way down to lay people. That way you organically develop your message. It won’t be an overnight goal but if you’re diligent and keep at it, you will see improvement over time.', 'Toastmasters is an excellent resource for presenting.\n\nI\'m assuming that presenting while prepared in front of an audience isn\'t a issue for you so I won\'t get into that.\n\nAs far as communicating ""on the fly"", it\'s a very rare skill in reality. \n\nTo let you in on a little ""secret"": most professionals who appear to be doing this either have presented the same thing many many times at which point preparation is no longer required, or they have cheat notes somewhere. In the actuarial world, it\'s possible to anticipate what kinds of questions are going to be asked in advance and so simply have those answers on hand (if presenting virtually) or in the ppt notes just in case they get asked and that tends to give a better impression.\n\nOne way to practice this skill is if you have kids or are around small kids, try improving stories or topics that they may be interested in without any preparation. It\'s low stakes, you can kind of fake it, and if you mess up you can turn it into a joke or redirect much more easily than adults and they\'ll let you off the hook faster.\n\nThe other way is to get good at making up stories in your head and explain whatever as though you are telling a story. The structure is essentially the same. Watch how comedians tell jokes in story form as an example.\n\nBeyond that, it\'s just practice and repetition. For lower stakes presentations start with being mostly prepared and a small piece ""on the fly"" and work your way up from that. \n\nFinal warning: if you are presenting numbers/facts/financial statements there\'s no getting out of having to memorize what they are or having a reference beside you but you can make up the ""story"" to go around it as you go with enough practice.', 'Math is just a language, just a more precise one.

If you can at least make yourself laugh, it almost certainly will benefit your presentation. Because it lowers the guard of your audience, and makes them more likely to be patient and understanding. In addition, it lowers your own guard, because it’s a reminder that there’s nothing to be scared of. It’s really difficult to be negative when your presenter is kinda funny.', 'Know your audience, a technical CFO needs different details than a non-technical marketing team.

Why do surrender charges exist?|19|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jic2sb/why_do_surrender_charges_exist/|Death_Planner|1742770105.0|9|1jic2sb|0.95|Probably a stupid question, but couldn't the cash value be defined to take account for surrender charges? E.g., instead of offering 1000 in CSV but 10% SC in year 1, we simply offer a 900 CSV. |"['Cost to sell the product could outweigh and normally does the profit for the first couple of years\n\nCost to exit the investment to settle the surrender', 'Surrender charges exist to help recuperate the pre-contract expenses that were incurred. In the first few years of a policy, the insurer is technically underwater on a policy, because they incur a bunch of expenses from commissions, underwriting, and such getting the policy on the books. Surrender charges exist to make sure that those expenses are at least partially recovered. \n\n\nAs for why the cash value before SC is what’s usually displayed, it is because that value has a lot more meaning to policyholders. The cash value before any SC is useful as a direct reflection of the rate of return they’re getting on the policy as an investment vehicle. \n\nThe value after surrender charges tho is only of use if you’re going to surrender.', 'I mean in essence that is the same thing, just being implicit instead of explicit. Customers tend to dislike when the number they see is different from the number they expect. So good business practice would suggest that any deviation from their expectation should be laid out clearly.', ""When UL products were first introduced, they had front end loads and no surrender charges. The market didn't like front end loads and the replacement products all used surrender charges. \n\nUnder current accounting rules, front end loads are treated very poorly. I had to GAAP a front end loaded policy that a UK sub sold. The product was very low risk with two years of premiums being received before any account value accrued. From then, the product was priced close to break even -- all the products were received in the first two years. GAAP made us defer all the profits for years into the future."", 'Some companies (I would even venture to say most, but I can’t be certain) define Account Value as the value of the account plus premium minus all expenses and COI, etc, all accumulated with interest. And then define a Cash Value that is the AV minus the SC, which would be what the policyholder gets if they decide to surrender the policy. That is why you’ll see in the earlier years of an illustration the AV has a positive amount, but the CV would be 0 as the SC is often equal to or even more than the total AV in earlier years.', 'I think rth got the main point across, but I want to add 2 things I dont see in the thread yet.\n\nFirst, your point makes some sense for traditional products with fixed premiums and guaranteed cash values, but there are also products with variable premiums leading to non-guaranteed cash values, such as UL. As others said, surrender charges are often a means of recouping acquisition costs, which for UL the main cost is usually commissions, which will vary with premium and therefore the cash value of the policy. That makes a surrender charge very lucrative as higher premiums = higher commissions, but also higher surrender charges in case the client does surrender early. Also you have to consider that UL often offers several investment options, so surrender charges are used as a means of recouping timing differences leading to losses between the clients surrender and the liquidity of their underlying fund.\n\nThe other is tax purposes. In Canada, one rule to keep policies tax exempt is that generally speaking, the cash value of the policy cannot exceed 250% of its value 3 years ago. If the company didnt use surrender charges and just offered lower cash values upfront that were equivalent, this would actually limit the potential growth further down the line, and would make the product less appealing to anyone who doesnt plan to surrender early anyways.', 'To define net amount at risk for purposes of computing charges, you use the amount gross of SC.', 'Ridiculous', 'What is?']"

I do think there are two things that really feed this sentiment for actuaries uniquely. My perspective comes as a career changer, so I’m just pointing out what is unique to this profession, there are other drivers that premiate other industries too…. \n\n(1) the exams themselves, as the process of getting through them, and the amount of funding and support companies provide for them feed the superiority complex over non-actuaries. Being an FSA/FCAS doesn’t make you special, or smarter than everyone without it. Plenty of high performing non-actuaries are just as intelligent as you and have better experience on how product or sales, or other functional areas of the company should operate. \n\n(2) Second, you are given significance almost immediately. It’s not uncommon for a new college grad in an actuarial role to have a Manager in finance or underwriting reaching out and asking for guidance on something and treating them as an expert. This is relatively unheard of in a majority of professions. I found it crazy how much influence I had in a multi billion dollar company in a supposed entry level job. Power corrupts absolutely. \n\nMoney among other things, are a huge factors too but as I said those are not unique to actuarial. Money for example drives the same issues in high performing sales. You can argue point 2 is also prevalent in attorneys and doctors but I’m thinking more in the business functions. \n\nHowever, I think you’re a bit out of touch with the amount of control you have over people’s personalities in your comments and ironically the idea that you think that either you or the SoA can actually change it through credentialing almost sounds a little like superiority forming.

I'm currently trying to help my data team processing the adjustment reason codes in the MMR  and put everything on a restated incurred basis. Is there code publicly available that exists so I don't have to reinvent the wheel?

On Part D I don't think it is applied to low income premium, low income cost sharing, and reinsurance subsidies, but I believe it is applied to CGDP and now MDP subsidies.

LFMU - Feeling Lost|5|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jgxr57/lfmu_feeling_lost/|CluelessActuarialKid|1742608659.0|5|1jgxr57|0.86|Hi all, I am taking LFMU in the upcoming spring 2025 sitting, and am feeling very lost on how to study for it. The syllabus is so large and right now it feels impossible to understand or memorize every small piece of information or calculation method. I am currently using TIA to study. What helped you the most? Was it flashcards, or practice exam questions, or something else? I know there are previous posts on this but would appreciate any new and updated insights. Any tips for studying for this exam would be immensely appreciated. Thanks everyone and all the best to those who are also studying!|"[""If you rearrange the letters of LFM you get FML which seem to capture how the exam makes people feel :'( best of luck to you though! \n\nWhen I prepared for the exam it was my last sitting and I just kept telling myself this is it the last sprint and that helped a little. What I found most helpful was trying to understand the big picture instead of being tied down to the details, this is the one exam that pure memorization just won't work because there's so much stuff. Once I understood what GAAP and Stat was doing everything just kind of fell into place. Then I took a vacation to Florida right after my Nov sitting :)"", 'Try to get familiar with all the calculations on part A and B and the context around when we need these calculations (e.g., MRB is used for guarantees in GAAP, etc.)', ""This is about the time where I'd start to get overwhelmed on the FSA sittings, too.  It could be good to just take a break for a few days."", ""LFM was the only exam I ever failed, but I passed it on my second try. My advice would be try to identify how different topics connect. Almost all FSA exam questions try to cover multiple readings/topics in one question. Nailing down flashcards is very necessary, but if you aren't able to synthesize the information to actually understand it, it might not work out. Don't give up! I had to completely switch my study method from basically just memorize with no thought behind it to understand the different regulations on a base level and build up additional info/details. You won't be able to memorize everything! I realized my strategy from the first 8 exams failed on LFM because there is too much material for a human to memorize. Understand the fundamentals to get all the basic questions right, and build from there. Good luck!"", ""I just passed LFMU after failing it three times. I would easily say that flash cards helped me the most. Better yet, recalling the flashcards in your own words. I would physically right down the answers to the flashcards in my own words to make sure I understood the material correctly. You don't have to write them down verbatim because that shows you just memorized it and that you don't entirely understand the material. Physically writing the answers helped ingrain them into my head.\n\nI would say exam questions arent that helpful as they test specific categories and the chance that they ask those exact questions again are very slim. It's better to understand the material which is why flashcards are goated.\n\n\nIt is a lot of material and easily the toughest exam. Just remember this, you don't have to get a perfect paper to pass and that if you're struggling with it, chances are everyone else taking it is struggling. You have made it this far and that at least shows you know what you're doing""]"

ALTAM Formula Sheet Changes (Put options/GMMB/GMDB)|2|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jf9nzp/altam_formula_sheet_changes_put_optionsgmmbgmdb/|obedeary|1742423133.0|7|1jf9nzp|1.0|"I just have to say I am so frustrated with the changes to the put pricing formulas the SOA is giving us for the next sitting of ALTAM. I sat for the first time last October and the formula sheet just had the basic Black-Scholes formulas for a put and d1/d2. Now they’ve made it so much more complicated by making it specific to GMMBs. I get that on the surface it might seem helpful because they’re giving more clarity for GMMB problems, but it’s actually really annoying regarding both the assumptions made for the new d1/d2 formulas as well as calculating GMDB values. Like… do they realize we need Black-Scholes to calculate GMDB prices, not just GMMBs?? Or am I missing something in the new syllabus?? It just seems like such a reductive and wasteful update. 

Anyway, I wanted to give a heads up to anyone studying for ALTAM that there are a couple things to watch out for regarding GMMBs/GMDBs:

1. You might want to just memorize the basic B-S put option formulas in order to price/value GMDBs because it will take too long on an already lengthy exam to work backwards from the formula on the sheet. I say this especially because GMDBs on the exam won’t necessarily be just the premium multiplied by some k like most GMMBs would be, and also because you can’t use P*Chi either for a GMDB since the fund value will vary based on the time of death. 

2. Be careful calculating d1 for a GMMB using the formula on the sheet. In the formula for p(t) they first write out the general expression using P*Chi without assuming continuous management charges and then the second expression assumes that structure of expenses. However, for d1, they go straight to assuming that expense structure. Based on the Coaching Actuaries manual I am just replacing the log term with ln(Chi*St/k) for a GMMB to make it more general. I feel like it is definitely not guaranteed that they would give a problem with this specific expense structure on the exam because they love to switch it up and give us scenarios that require modifying the basic formulas, so I personally am preparing using a more general approach. 

Okay, rant over. Good luck to everyone studying out there!! 🫡 "|"[""People don't have black-scholes memorized off the top of their head anymore?\n\nBring back IFM!"", ""I didn't know there was a change from CA formula sheet.

However, I'm getting worried about not trying something different to get different experiences before settling into a specific industry for the rest of my career.

Also could be because I really want to better understand the healthcare system and how actuarial skills are applied in it.

Should I just stick with what I know and comfortable with and try to find other skills to learn or different functions (there's opportunities for other functions but it would still be within the same type of business and every extra year means it will be harder to try something different entirely).

I'm worried about risking switching to something else entirely (and I'm sure I'll have to take a pay cut, may even need to apply to a lower title position?). Also I don't want to go into upper management. I like being an IC or managing a small team (1-2 people max).

Why do we settle for less?|0|https://i.redd.it/mfm32zzzoppe1.jpeg|Stargazer_Epsilon|1742418572.0|17|1jf7wex|0.29|"
I understand we all have different reasons for becoming an actuary. Coasting to “upper middle income” is straightforward and “good WLB” is a selling point.

When people bring up wanting to make more, do more in their career, the default response is usually “find hobbies and live life, you already make enough, especially if you live in LCOL”

I personally have more ambition than that. As do many people I know. Some of us don’t want to live in a sad, LCOL town and reap the MCOL pay in a remote job.

I want a HCOL lifestyle, a HCOL environment, HCOL pay, and a HCOL career. I don’t want to settle for less. I want a smart, smoking wife that has high standards, as I do, and who will leave me instead of settling for less. I don’t find it a bragging right that we have the lowest divorce rates.

200k is not enough for that. 200k is not sufficient to secure an organic diet, vibrant social life, interesting exercise regiment, fully relaxing vacations, experiences, and a solid education for kids. I want my family to be in the climate of California, in the education paradise of Massachusetts, or in the most affluent and beautiful areas we can find.

Let’s not convince ourselves and each other to be content with what we’re given. Let’s aim for higher and stop shooting ourselves in the foot. I don’t want to be stereotyped as a math nerd who will work a 9-5 and be a cog in a machine if I can help it. And I don’t want to see our sad salary surveys increase by only 2% each year. Please help me raise the industry benchmarks, try to achieve our full potential, and we will all be happier for it."|"['I think your standards might be a bit too low.

Thanks!"|['Depends on the product, but yes generally guarantees of various types, won’t get into specifics.

The PBM will also have networks and formularies that are part of the product and customization of those formularies could impact the expected performance of various guarantees.', 'Mind_Mission’s response is good. At the end of the day, Rx pricing essentially follows this process: take some claims experience, apply assumptions (cost/utilization trends, product shifts, market changes, etc.), reprice the adjusted experience with contracted rates, apply final adjustments (conservatism, risk tolerance, margin,etc.). None of this should be surprising to anyone with experience in any other pricing/ratemaking. \n\nThe nuances with Rx are largely in the variety of pricing models, the sheer number of distinct pricing aspects that can influence a price, the opaqueness of the Rx pricing market, and the gaming that follows such a complex and opaque financial space.']

Burnt out - need advice (ALTAM)|11|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1je4kii/burnt_out_need_advice_altam/|Intrepid_Duck_3737|1742303413.0|12|1je4kii|0.87|"Hoping anyone can relate to this. Passed FAM in November and started to study for the April ALTAM a week after that sitting. I tend to need to study more than the average person and I think I’m finally hitting a complete burnout from continuously studying for every other prelim since late 2021 (with about a 2-3 months break between exams). Burnt out as in I can’t even force myself to work through a single problem or go over flash cards for 20 minutes. I don’t think I’m even close to being on pace for a 6. For past exams I’ve been able to put my head down and grind through the final stretch but at this point it feels like i just hit a wall, especially with how dense the material is.

All that’s left for my ASA is the ASF and ATPA. I’m strongly considering taking a couple week break and jumping ship to work on knocking those 2 off since the next ALTAM sitting is in October. I know it sounds counterintuitive to shift to ATPA but I more so need the break from the ALTAM material. Ideally I can knock ASF + ATPA off by May/June, take another small break and can revisit ALTAM with more time to work with. Does this seem fair? I’m only considering this because I think with an extra couple months I could definitely pass ALTAM, so I’d rather take it with confidence vs crawling to the finish line"|"['Take a break for a few days.', 'Just take a break for a couple of days and do the things you like, come back refreshed and stronger', ""It's totally reasonable to take a 6 month break to do modules.\n\nI thought I was going to take a year off after ASA before FSA, but it turned out doing modules and having all the waiting for FA grading and APC was enough."", ""I feel you. I experienced severe burnout while I was taking the FAM and ALTAM exams, both twice as I failed the first sittings for them.  \nHere's my two cents. Regardless of what you're feeling right now about your progress on ALTAM, just take the sitting. I did that while I knew I would fail, and it helped me a lot for the second sitting. This exam is written format, and the user interface for this exam is quite different compared to other CBT exams. By taking the sitting, you should be more comfortable with the new interface when you take it again in October. Unless your company is not going to pay for the second sitting (I know the exam fee is expensive!), just go and take the exam. You'll receive a grade slip with percentage for each question once you get the failing result, so you'd know what to expect for this exam. Just write down as much as you know and you'll notice that you'd get at least some points for whatever you wrote, plus you'd know how tight the given 3.5 hours is for this exam, so you should be able to prepare accordingly for your next sitting.  \nYour timeline is similar to mine. I failed April sitting and I did ASF while I was waiting for the result, then I started studying again for ALTAM from late July for the October sitting. The result was success!  \nGiven the wait time for grading is about 11 weeks for ALTAM, you can do both ATPA and ASF depending on your familiarity with ATPA. Or you can defer the ASF modules after the October sitting of ALTAM if the time is tight. ASF can be done within a week or so if you have the time to concentrate.  \nBest of the luck for you! You're so close, so keep your head up and knock them out!"", 'You can always skip a sitting. Nothing will happen', ""I'm in the exact same boat as you and feel the exact same way. My thinking is the same as others have mentioned, if there's no penalty from your company for failing then you might as well take it and get some experience with the interface, etc. \n\nI try and think about studying for an exam as finishing a long, long hike. Sure I can stop and rest as much as needed, but that doesn't change how far I need to go and every minute spent studying is an inch closer to the finish."", ""You mentioned you need to study more than the average person. I struggle with this, too. If you've been studying since late November or early December, you're burnt out, and you think you're definitely not on pace to pass in April, I think waiting to start again in June is a bad idea. If you're going to be studying for a totally unrelated exam/module for a few months, you're gonna have to start pretty much from scratch in June and then sit for ALTAM in October. Unless your employment is at risk if you don't pass something between June and October, I'd say keep studying for ALTAM. Take a break for a few days. If, after that, you really think you won't pass in April: slow down. Take some really good notes on the material you've covered so far. After you sit in April, take a break for a couple weeks, then pick it back up, but take it slow and find some time to enjoy life a little."", 'I have found taking a weekend off and then having a strict schedule helps.

Not sure if that’s logical or I’m just trying to convince myself it is lol', 'Yep that’s very valid. There is no penalty so I’ll at least sit for it. This is probably the third time in a row I’ve hit a rut a month out and I think taking a step away this time is probably the way I’m gonna go depending how I feel after another week or so. Just gotta be sure I don’t half ass October if I do decide to take a break lol. Goodluck to you!', 'Yea, after thinking about everything for a few days I’m on the same page as what you said. I’ve been sacrificing a good amount of sleep for studying since January and ive just been hurting myself if anything lol. Definitely plan to keep going at a slower pace and not keep pushing hard. Thanks for the input!', 'I see what you mean. That would depend a lot on your confidence with the ATPA material and your mental health. Assuming you\'ve already passed SRM and PA, I don\'t think there’s a ton of new material to learn for ATPA, but you might need some time to get the hang of coding and to build up the energy required to complete the assessment.\n\nIt seems like you could target the Jun-August 2025 version of ATPA  ([ATPA Assessment Submission Deadlines and Grade Release Schedule | SOA](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/exam-day-info/atpa-submission-schedule/)). If you take ALTAM in April and continue mildly studying for it up until the exam date, you’d still have about three months to focus on ATPA, starting in early May and aiming to finish the assessment by the end of July. That way, you\'d have enough time to return to ALTAM in August, with a good amount of time remaining until October to prepare for a second sitting. I studied about 280 hours for my first ALTAM sitting and hard failed with grade 3, but I didn\'t start studying for it again until the end of July except for ASF that I finished in about couple weeks. Then I passed in the second sitting with about 200+ hours of studying. So, hopefully, you\'d be in a similar spot for the ALTAM side, and the question would be like ""Are three months of studying enough for ATPA?""\n\nHowever, one major downside of this schedule is that you’d be studying nonstop until October. If that feels overwhelming, I’d recommend being kind to yourself—maybe focus on just one exam at a time and take some breaks between sittings to avoid burnout.']"
How do get past bad experiences at work?|83|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1jds4t9/how_do_get_past_bad_experiences_at_work/|Plastic-Carrot-2988|1742256886.0|49|1jds4t9|0.93|"I realized out of about 15 younger analysts, I was the only one consistently left out of the larger parties and group activities (including study groups) the others held. Most people would come to parties I held, but then I’d be left out of Both casual in office breaks or post work activities, barring my mentor inviting me. I’ve since learned I’m too high energy and care too much, and can’t seem to read people, so I’d try to ask my mentor or other trusted people for guidance. And generally would be told I was just anxious. But eventually I learned I was only ever invited out of pity. And all the anxious worries that people were being odd and I maybe didn’t belong were true.

I lost count of the number of times friends would talk about upcoming parties at the office just to be uncomfortable when they realized I was never invited.

Today I released Actuarial Playground: a visual and interactive actuarial cashflow model you can explore (and change) right now on [ActuarialPlayground.com](http://ActuarialPlayground.com)

Here's a video where I use it to interpret pricing and cross-subsides:

Besides being visual and interactive, in the Playground:

\- calculations are described by [calculang](https://calculang.dev): a language for calculations designed for *all calculations and models* and *not a black box*

\- calculations execute in Javascript - the language of the web and a ubiquitous platform for modelling: in your organisation, in your browser, in the cloud, and even on your mobile

I think this is the first such interactive/Javascript actuarial cashflow model, and both calculang and the Playground are free and open source - with some notes about the Playground model under the '❓' tab.

Why become an actuary over an SWE or data scientist?|48|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1ja8vsk/why_become_an_actuary_over_an_swe_or_data/|loafingleisure|1741861808.0|22|1ja8vsk|0.77|"I'm (24, late bloomer) currently a stats major and Ive been programming on and off since I was 15 and Im fairly confident Im more competent at SWE than a majority of fresh compsci grads. Ive created some quant finance related scripts in the past related to statistical arb (cointegration, PCA, etc), options pricing, vanilla arb.  Id like to go into quant finance ideally but if that doesnt work out I figure Im well positioned to go into data science, actuarial, or SWE.

Im intrigued by actuarial because it seems much more straightforward to break into and progress professionally in than these other fields, but salaries and earning potential are lower from what I can tell. 

Is there a reason for someone with my background to become an actuary? Or is data science a better fit if I want to use my programming skills? 

And to be controversial, why would anyone become an actuary if the salaries are so much lower than SWE and data science? Is it purely because its easier to break into and less of a grind to progress professionally?"|"['This question is asked quite frequently on this subreddit. I’m locking and not removing the post because people had valuable things to say, but questions about entering the field should be posted in our pinned thread for common questions.', 'Job security.\n\nYou may be able to make more down the line with some other careers, but as an actuary you know the market won’t be flooded with competition if some other industry gets laid off en masse.  Exams help regulate entry level talent and prevent people from simply moving directly into higher level roles altogether.', 'where is your data that salaries are so much lower? usually when people make these claims they are looking at MANGA salaries for top people and compared to average actuary claims. yes SWE and DS have higher ceilings, but actuaries have higher floors and a clear path.  \n\nIt also is different work, why be a doctor when you could be a dentist?', 'Better work life balance, easier to coast once you’re past exams', 'If want to make as much money as possible, become an entrepreneur, don’t do any of these things. \n\nIf you love to code, don’t become an actuary. Actuaries are business professionals. There is no reason a coder should choose insurance over everything else. \n\nJob security is high as an actuary today, but not as high as you may think. Even 5+ years ago most actuaries had some threat to their long term business outlook, whether that was autonomous driving in P&C or the ever present legislative and regulatory reform pressure in health (Medicare for All only the worst case). Actuarial jobs are safe, but one of these things changing has the potential to absolutely decimate / saturate the job market. It won’t be tomorrow, but if you’re talking a 30 year horizon, don’t make assumptions. \n\nThe main reason to become an actuary is exactly what you mention, easier progression and entry, no advanced schooling, easy pathway to earnings, and lack of significant technical requirements. I encourage anyone that doesn’t want to be a coder, has enough math skill to get through exams (which is the only place it is needed and doesn’t really go past calculus 2 99% of the time), and wants a guaranteed good salary out of school, to think about actuarial.\n\nA career path and job can be awesome without being everyone’s first choice, or being the most lucrative. The problem is too many people compare Data Science and SWE as being very similar to actuarial, and we need to squash that imo. People are not regularly spamming Neurosurgeons about why they didn’t pursue a job in big tech, or asking Attorneys why they didn’t pursue quant finance. \n\nPeople also misrepresent the talent pool. A majority of working actuaries I know would never make it in quant finance or as a big tech SWE anyway.

The higher SWE pay is somewhat salary but mostly of equity driven. Once adjusting for geography, salaries are a bit closer than you’d think.\n\nLastly, actuaries don’t code as much as you think.

For my personal emergency fund, I use some basic personalized descriptive statistics and demographics data to have something slightly more accurate than the simple ""your income multiplied by 3 - 6 months"" rule-of-thumb thrown around the internet.

I came upon actuarial science when looking for ways that I can adopt from the professional world to build a more accurate E.F. model.

I would love to have an idea about how crazy one can go with it if they were to build the most overengineered model using the industry best practices. Just looking for the right direction if I wanted to study some of the concepts that you use in your everyday lives."|"['1. Find the probability of each emergency in one year\n2. Find the costs of each emergency\n3. Multiply each cost by the corresponding probability and sum them up to get your emergency fund\n4. Choose to be conservative and add a 50% load to your emergency fund', ""In real life I do an annual review of what I spent money on by importing & categorizing transactions from all my accounts, and use that + an inflation assumption to set a monthly budget. You may be surprised to learn most actuarial models are simpler than what the exams prepare us for, you don't necessarily see a huge increase in precision with the added sophistication.\n\nIf you're just playing around, you can establish frequency and severity probability distributions for the various expenses you might incur in your projection window and run stochastic models to see a distribution of how much money you'd spend in a 1,000 different scenarios, and then instead of setting your reserve at 3-6 months of a point estimate monthly expense, maybe you set your emergency fund at a level that covers 3 months expense in 95% of your scenarios.\n\nYou have frequent fixed costs that are easy to model in the short term: Rent, insurance premiums, Spotify subscription, etc. We know when these charges occur and how much they will cost.\n\nYou have frequent variable costs that can get a little fancier: Weekly grocery bill, gas/water/electric, fun money, maybe these expenses occur once a week guaranteed, but their cost (severity) is normally distributed. Maybe your gas and electric bills are higher in the winter so you factor the time of year into the model.\n\nThen the real fun is in the infrequent and large variable costs: Roof damage in a hailstorm, medical expenses, water heater breaks, need to buy a new car, etc."", 'Stochastic modelling probably.\n\nAssume the probability of each emergency scenario varies over time. Assume the severity of each scenario is a random variable as well.\n\nProceed to run a million simulations where you see what the total cost would be after 1 year (or however long you want). Define your emergency fund to be something like the CTE95 of the results of your simulations.\n\nBonus points if you account for the impact each emergency could have on others. As an example, an earthquake would have its own estimated costs, but what are the chances it also causes you to be laid off and lose your source of income? Or hospitalize you? Or both?', ""I do scenarios with mine. Those can get pretty complicated quite fast. But I use a lot of assumptions to simplify it. I actually find it quite fun. \n\nBut mine isn't just the emergency fund, it's all my finances."", 'I use YNAB to track my finances and the biggest lessons from that have been (1) that most things others call “emergencies” really aren’t, and (2) most of what’s left will mostly get handled by insurance policies.  Actual income replacement for losing employment is pretty much all that’s left for an “emergency fund”.\n\nFor examples of the former:  Variable heating and electric bills follow predictable patterns, you can plan ahead.  Annual bills like Christmas shopping and insurance premiums can be planned for a little every month.  You know your car and house both need regular maintenance, track your costs and plot out the cost and expected lifespan of major components, and start budgeting a monthly amount to cover it.  Your car might be paid off, but how long do you expect it to last and to cost to replace - set aside a car payment to yourself.  Best part of all these is that you can earn interest on the money instead of paying interest on “surprises”.\n\nAs for the second… true surprises basically look like a tree falling on your car, a serious medical expense, or a fire at your house.  All of those are events better handled by insurance than any kind of emergency fund.  Additionally, if you managed to prepare for all your non-surprises thoroughly, you’ll have enough cash on hand to float through any delays getting paid by insurance.\n\nThat brings us back to simply being prepared for losing the job that is funding all of this.  Pick a number of months that feels reasonable to find another job, multiply that by your monthly expenses (and sinking funds) and call it a day.\n\nTLDR:  An “emergency fund” is easy, but properly planning for predictable long-run expenses can take a little bit of work.', ""In order to over engineer:\n\n1. Think about how many different types of events there are that could cost you money.\n2. How often can each even event happen in a year (regardless of whether the other events happen or not)? Fit a frequency distribution to each variable.\n3. What is the distribution of losses from each event? Fit a loss distribution per event & per type of event.\n4. Simulate from each loss variable: frequency times severity.\n5. Fit a copula to model the correlation of losses given each independent distribution of losses coming from the simulations.\n6. Simulate 1,000,000 years of losses from the copulas.\n7. Think about what's an acceptable probability of going bankrupt in one year and choose that quantile from the distribution of 1,000,000 losses you just simulated."", 'I’m surprised most answers so far have focused on the amount of emergency fund. I think the real optimization with an emergency fund is in asset allocation. Most people assume an emergency fund should be in cash, but that has an opportunity cost. Rather than over-engineer how you arrive at the right amount of capital, it’s better to assess your risk tolerance for how the capital is held. \n\nSuppose you decide you need 6 months of emergency fund to guard against a scenario where you’re out of work for 6 months. It’s probably not optimal to always hold 6 months of cash. Rather, it’s better to hold some mix of cash and equities. Maybe invest it 50/50 in cash and equities. \n\nIn my adult lifetime, the worst stock market event was the 2008 crisis when the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value in a single year. That’s only happened a handful of times in the last 100 years, so let’s call it a 5% event. The probability that this happens and you lose your job is even lower than 5%. So the chances of your 6 month fund being worth only 4.5 months is extremely low and probably an acceptable level of risk for most people. \n\nThe nice thing about this approach is that it turns your emergency fund into a multi-purpose fund that could be used for other things, and it encourages a sound savings and investment habit that will likely lead to even bigger funds and ultimately make the original risk of needing an emergency fund immaterial.', 'Rather than calculating the probability of an event you could have enough to cover until the waiting period on your disability income plus at least the deductibles for all homeowners/auto/health insurance. To be even more conservative you could have your out of pocket maximums as well.', 'You could set up, in excel, sinking funds that you are depositing money into in your actual bank account. These funds would accrue to cover the cost of a new roof, major repairs/replacement of a car, boiler/hot water tank, etc.\n\nYou could determine the starting value of these sinking funds based on current age of the various major components and then enact replacement plans in X years. These things seem much more like property management principles than actuarial science though.', 'Lots of others are giving great ideas on how much to put in. Here’s an idea of a potential hierarchy of places to park the cash, obv the #of months of typical expenses for each bucket is just a stand in for how much you actually want to have easily accessible, based on all the other considerations people have mentioned:\n\n1-2 months checking account (flexible range to reduce rebalancing frequency with other accounts)\n1 month Savings account\n1 month Money markets\n1 month High yield savings accounts\nX# months in CDs of varying durations\nX# months in Roth IRA with allocations in various assets (I recommend low cost, diversified index funds) with increasing levels of risk — recognizing that you can only pull out principal not interest gained (unless you’re over 59 1/2 and it’s been there at least 5 years)\n\nMoney flows from top to bottom as your income comes in and you’re building the emergency fund structure, and the if you have an emergency, you try to pull out from the bottom assets as soon as timing is optimal (e.g. CDs maturity dates, or when index funds are high or at least not in recession), and pull from the rest above to smooth things over until it is optimal.\n\nIdeally your income and expenses are predictable with timing relatively closely matched, your buckets stay relatively stable (some fluctuation depending on life or maybe planned expenditures, as others have mentioned), and all surplus above your defined buckets above flows into your general investment portfolio.', ""I'd make your emergency fund equal 6*certain types of costs and if it's big enough split it between checking and high yield savings with a schedule of how much the fund should be over time--do salary projections, inflation, more kids, whatever you can think of.

I think the best approach would be to transfer the risk to insurance where applicable such as health and home insurance.', 'I’ll second this YNAB plug, it’s fantastic.', ""It's not that surprising considering what you're proposing would be a 'risky' approach and most people here are fairly risk averse.\n\nEmergency funds are first and foremost a question of liquidity. Can you get the money quickly, and can you get it out without it losing material value? Holding cash solves both of those. You could advocate for bonds once it has some bulk since you can't access quickly, but equities aren't nearly as safe as you're making out in actual liquidity scenarios for people. You don't get to pick when you sell, and you don't get to pick when you have an emergency. You can avoid the risk related with one by not investing in equities if you're funding a specific account for emergencies.\n\nIt's worth noting though that what you're proposing is just the natural lifecycle of anyone that builds any sort of 'fund' via continued savings. It's always worth recognizing that you will always need an 'emergency fund' held in easily convertible assets (i.e. cash, bonds) in any emergency scenario, it always just starts with cash and works its way up. Some people open specific investment portfolios in separate accounts and manage them separately from their emergency funds, some do the same as you do. That becomes more a question of how 'you' want to manage your money which I understand is what you're partially advocating for, but you need to consider that an 'emergency fund' needs to always exist even within your 'multi-purpose fund'. It's just not great financial advice to tell people that their rainy day funds should be in any sort of risky asset, because in your proposed 5% event they'll have lost enough value to be in a real rut. (Also somewhat absurd that you pick where it lost 50% value, you're not even taking into account just anything under 5% which is still a worse hit in a single year than holding cash)\n\nI think saving is good, and investing is good too, but there's definitely an incremental approach to be taken. Determining an emergency fund target is way more important than any asset allocation within the fund, and I think the other responses correctly focus on that."", ""I'm sorry we have different senses of humor."", 'That\'s exactly what insurers do as well - Insurance companies enter ""reinsurance"" contracts to exchange certain catastrophic risks for a known monthly premium with a reinsurance company.\n\nE.g: ""Specific Stop Loss"" is a concept in health insurance where if any member in a group has claims exceeding a defined amount, say $1,000,000, the excess amount is the reinsurer\'s liability. Then the health insurer can cap the severity in their modeling and add the SSL premium to their known expenses instead to reduce the variance in their expenses.', 'Yes I was definitely focused on long term saving and cultivating a mindset that leads to that. The more you can accumulate and grow, the lower the risk of insolvency long term, which is ultimately what the emergency fund seeks to mitigate. Cash itself has its own risks and is very vulnerable to inflation. So this was just my over-engineered/holistic/long-term approach to what the OP was asking. \n\nAnother way to look at it: match layers of emergency fund with probability of needed liquidity. For example, keep 3 months of cash for immediate access to cover a sudden expense or job loss. Then another layer in something a little riskier for lower probability event like long term job loss or a more significant illness. Then a final layer in riskier investments for an even lower probability event like a major medical situation, disability, etc. \n\nMain point: increase the risk exposure of the fund in relation to the likelihood of needing to liquidate it. If the events never happen, you’re all the better long term.', 'I think he they have a point, OP should also engage a third party to trade portions of his emergency fund risk with other emergency fund holders and thus reduce tail risk']"

Since my background isn’t directly in reinsurance, what key topics should I focus on? Are there any technical concepts, industry trends, or common interview questions I should be ready with?

Any insight would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance."|"['From my entry level reinsurance interviews (life), they loved to ask about presentation/communication experience. \n\nFrom the 3 companies I spoke to, they all compared their specific roles to consulting. They did mention they have peers that are much more “back of house” experience study/investment experts. Since I was interviewing for life reinsurance roles, most of these were mortality/morbidity studies. I know nothing of the P&C world beyond SOA prelims and personal experience.  \n\nThe technical questions they asked me were about how to weight certain experience from different companies/regions. You have all this data from huge chunks of the industry— what makes the most sense to pay the most mind to for certain events? Spatial considerations are probably huge here for you.\n\nOne of mine also used riddles and probability questions just to hear me thinking out loud about solving them. I am sure this is not going to happen to you lol.\n\nBasic questions of “how do reinsurers make money?” and “what types of events would be good/bad for us?” Also came up. Being very familiar with the risk sharing/profit sharing relationships would be the biggest thing to focus on. Also, they would likely be impressed if you threw in more “business-y” considerations like keeping a client happy instead of just raw actuarial considerations. \n\nA question type that might come up is “we have a client that has *this type* of experience. What kind of reinsurance contract would THEY want to have and what kind of reinsurance contract do WE want to give them?”\n\nHope this helps! I know the process will probably be a little different for you (life vs P&C, EL vs almost ACAS). Good luck.', ""If the role is more on treaty pricing, get a proper understanding of how treaties are structured and their terms, ie how experience and exposure rating is done for excess and proportional treaties, and for excess, you could ask what the company's strategy is for participating (whether it's across the tower/more on upper layers,etc.)\n\nif it's reserving, the work is not unlike what you would find in primary insurance in principle, but requires more refined knowledge of the underlying business because it can be quite heterogeneous.

Keeping it a bit vague, you could tell them you are worried about not passing the exam because you are struggling to find time to study while managing you work and personal responsibilities.

Some unexpected projects at work made it impossible for her to get the study hours she needed.

However, you know best where you are at and what works for you. \n\nMy colleague decided not to sit for the exam and our boss supported that. She knew that she had not studied enough to have an effective attempt at passing. It\'s a tough decision but in the end, it would just add stress and possibly shatter your confidence for no good reason.  \n\nYou also have a family, so you have to decide if you can get enough study hours over the next 6-7 weeks to make an attempt worth it.

Once because 3/4s of the department I was working in left over the course of 2 months (for unrelated reasons).. great pd opportunity but for exam progress not so much.\n\nDepending on how the study program works, I would suggest studying for what you can when you can even if it's not all the material so at least if you are going to have to do it again you will at least have studied something vs nothing rather than giving up completely.  But if it's going to have you end up on disability or threaten your health in any serious way then just accept the loss of the study attempt."", 'I was on track to take my next FSA exam last fall, but had a personal tragedy after I had finished learning all the material and making/reviewing flashcards for the whole exam. I was right about to start on practice exams and register, but decided to stop pursuing my FSA.

I ended up in the hospital for the entire two weeks leading up to the exam. I thought my options were to just not show up or show up and get a 1 or 2. But SOA were able to move my registration to the next sitting but I wasn't well enough to study to fully prepared. I ended up with 4 for that sitting but honestly thought it would score much lower. I knew going in I wasn't passing.\n\nThen I do finally come around to passing the exam a year and half later than I wanted to, and suddenly, its coming off the required list... nice. Glad I went through the stress of learning all the material that has nothing to do with my job or career path!\n\nI have continued related health issues that make it difficult for me to be prepared for more than 1 sitting a year.

However, in the past couple of years, my work quality has been much higher than previously, and I am usually working more than is required to make sure projects get completed. I have become a go-to person in my department for my knowledge of our data and processes. I actually enjoy my work in a business transformation role, too. But I would often come home late or exhausted, not exercising as often, and would just watch TV instead of studying. Which is on me. Even though I am out of the study program, my boss said I could use down time here and there during the day to study, and suggested that I take advantage of our remote hybrid work schedule to use commute time to study. After having studied for 11 hours total since December for my 7th sitting, I think, of MAS-I, I got home tonight after playing pickup basketball at work, had dinner, and got out my materials to study. I looked at a few Flashcards, started doing a problem, and six minutes in I thought to myself “what am I doing. There is about a month left and I have barely studied up to this point. I am not going to pass.” So I came on here to find other people who have had a similar experience. It is so frustrating. I believe I have the ability to pass with enough effort and study hours put in, but it is difficult to get myself to study. I do enjoy the profession, but when I do study, I often get stuck and just sit there kind of frozen. Work itself has become an avoidance mechanism and distraction from studying. I used to not work as hard to conserve myself for studying, but I would struggle studying anyway, so at some point I decided to go all in with work, but now it is probably too much. But doing great at work and not so great on exams is better than not being great at either. It must be just managing time and energy - our work environment is pretty relaxed and the emphasis is more on exams than actual work product. I probably am indeed caring too much about work, in this context, and can shift emphasis onto the exams. I feel like, because of not having the exams, it puts me at a lower status in my group, even if I am one of the more technically skilled and system-knowledgeable analysts in my department. It even feels unfair. Anyway, I just often feel alone in my actuarial journey, and lacking a circle of support, and it was nice to find that other people have gone through similar situations. The others in my group keep to themselves and I don’t feel like I have people to study with or talk exam material with.

Hi, I'm a professional data analyst (5+ years of experience) looking to transition into actuarial science. I'm looking for an actuarial analyst 1 role or something similar but have had no luck. Can someone please take a look at my resume and provide some feedback? Not sure what I've done wrong.

It's kind of tough but you may be 'over-qualified' for EL.  If you did have a 3rd exam pass, recently, that might help, but I know it's kind of annoying having to pick SOA / CAS already... but the lack of a recent exam pass may be giving people pause too."", 'Are you ready for the pay-cut?

I think what APChemGang is maybe getting at with the question about a pay-cut: your resume screams technical capabilities, and working to a deadline with clients. Which are great things. That\'s usually the table stakes for an interview where we look for the softer skills.\n\nBut what\'s missing is a story about ""why actuary?"" And ""why insurance?"" and ""What are you looking for that you\'ll be happy here?""', 'You have a good resume, but it’s not catered for the actuarial field because you’re specialized in data analytics. I agree with others saying you might take a pay cut and you haven’t taken an exam in a long time. Overall, I’m not getting the feeling you’re committed to the actuarial field. You’re better off working as a data analyst in the actuarial industry, passing an exam, then transitioning to an actuarial role.', 'Are you studying for anything or have a sitting planned soon? I would definitely add something that shows you’re currently working towards credentials. Your most recent exam being 7 years ago is probably a red flag to employers.', 'You seem very impressive, and I would certainly defer to the advice of those in the field posting here. However, as someone who has done quite a bit of hiring and read a lot of resumes, I think it might be worth considering if you could identify your highest priority/most relevant projects (or themes, if that is more feasible) to your desired new career field from your two positions and perhaps speak more (and more meaningfully) to those fewer items rather than saying less about so many different things.

I would pick a date to take an exam and the put ""sitting in June 2025"" or whatever.\n\nGranted, I know there are fewer shared CAS/SOA exams nowadays so that may be more difficult.  But I\'d probably just pick a path.  This will also help you focus your job search more and seem genuinely interested in a given position.\n\nYes, it limits your search. \n\nBut the differences between life actuary and P&C actuary are significant.  I\'d argue as a P&C actuary my job has more in common with P&C underwriting than with life actuarial.  I\'d do some reading and pick which career path you like more because they aren\'t as interchangeable as people make them out to be, and I don\'t think interest in one implies interest in another.', ""I'd love to know the main reason behind the reservation.

Not saying it’s easy to land, but you seem to be well qualified for a number of mid-level data roles at most large companies in the US. The persistent question people will have is why?\n\nIf it’s just insurance, I’d recommend the plethora of data roles insurance companies have. There is plenty there to work with.

I’d consider being able to land midlevel roles as “developed a career” much the same as an ASA/ACAS or early FCAS/FSA has', 'Fair, though analysts are also starting more like $80-90k in HCOL now and comp grows quickly with exams. \n\nIf they get their ASA, the actuarial career gives them a pretty clear path to $150k in ~5 years, or maybe sooner if they can leverage their data analysis skills to become an important storyteller sooner. FSA and $200k+ might be a higher ceiling than their industry, etc.']"

PolySystems or Python Model Dev? 5 YOE|1|https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1j86mjp/polysystems_or_python_model_dev_5_yoe/|Ina_Pickle_7324|1741633692.0|1|1j86mjp|0.6|"Hey all! I have two interesting job offers on the table. The comp/benefits are the same.

Details about the two positions

LTC Modeling, PolySystems 

Variable Annuity Modeling, Python

The main things I'm thinking about:

Manager
I connected better with the manager for the Poly role and have been burned by terrible managers in the past. The manager for the Python role did not seem terrible, we just didn't seem to vibe as well and he was pretty shy and maybe nervous during the interview and didn't tell me much about himself, the role, the team.

The role itself
I am mainly concerned that most companies don't use Poly these days from what I've heard at least. I already have model development experience so I'm a little afraid Poly would hurt my resume. On the other hand, I have very little Python experience and that would be a huge resume builder.

Smaller differences 

Learning curve
There will probably be a decent learning curve for either role since I don't know Poly or Python. It's possible the learning curve would be a little higher for the Python role, but possibly worth it. Also I can learn Python more on my own from online resources.

Team makeup
The Python position is all men, while I'm a female. I could see this having pros and cons. The Poly role has a female manager and other female reports.

Remote
I would be a remote worker in either role. The Poly role is okay with remote but no one else is remote. The Python role has most employees remote and overseas resources in India so the team may be more used to a remote work environment.

My experience so far: Traditional Life Model Development, Variable Annuity Valuation, EIA Pricing, and Model Governance. 5 YOE, pre-ASA.

Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially regarding Poly use in the actuarial industry.

Thanks in advance!"|"[""Python. No question. MUCH more future proof.\n\nPython is current, free to learn and use, and has a global community of millions of users.

If interest rates increase by 1%, bond values decrease approximately duration%, and vice versa.\n\nThis loss is offset as their bonds mature. They were invested in low interest bonds. As these mature, the proceeds and new cash will be invested in higher interest bonds.\n\nThe impacts on individual companies will vary based upon their investment policies and claim payment patterns.', 'From a P&C standpoint, interest rate risk is directly tied to the “tail” of a line, with long tailed lines like WC being more exposed to it.
